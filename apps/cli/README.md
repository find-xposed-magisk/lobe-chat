# @lobehub/cli

LobeHub command-line interface.

## Acceptance skill

The acceptance skill is maintained in [lobehub/acceptance](https://github.com/lobehub/acceptance).
Install from the repository's default branch:

```bash
lh acceptance install
```

Update the installed skill:

```bash
lh acceptance update
```

Creating acceptances and publishing reports require authentication. Run `lh login`
before using those commands.

This selects the same source as `npx skills add lobehub/acceptance --skill acceptance`.
Changes merged into the default branch are available on the next install or
update, without a tag, GitHub Release, or skill-version bump. Installed files
remain unchanged until you run an update.

`install` skips existing files unless `--force` is passed. `update` replaces the
materialized files in `.agents/skills/acceptance`, removes stale resources, and
maintains agent links. The server resolves a commit and downloads the entire
skill from that snapshot before files are changed. `--json` reports the exact
source commit and the version declared in `SKILL.md`; that version is a label,
not the selector for default updates.

Use an up-to-date CLI and LobeHub server. Older servers may return `401` during
installation and need to be upgraded.

To select an existing version tag explicitly, use `lh acceptance update --skill-version 0.5.0` (requires the updated CLI and server), or the equivalent
[tagged skill source](https://github.com/lobehub/acceptance/tree/v0.5.0/skills/acceptance)
with `npx skills add`. A later `lh acceptance update` without `--skill-version`
returns to the current default-branch source.

## Local Development

| Task                                       | Command                    |
| ------------------------------------------ | -------------------------- |
| Run in dev mode                            | `bun run dev -- <command>` |
| Build the CLI                              | `bun run build`            |
| Link `lh`/`lobe`/`lobehub` into your shell | `bun run cli:link`         |
| Remove the global link                     | `bun run cli:unlink`       |

- `bun run build` only generates `dist/index.js`.
- To make `lh` available in your shell, run `bun run cli:link`.
- After linking, if your shell still cannot find `lh`, run `rehash` in `zsh`.

## Custom Server URL

By default the CLI connects to `https://app.lobehub.com`. To point it at a different server (e.g. a local instance):

| Method               | Command                                                         | Persistence                         |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Environment variable | `LOBEHUB_SERVER=http://localhost:4000 bun run dev -- <command>` | Current command only                |
| Login flag           | `lh login --server http://localhost:4000`                       | Saved to `~/.lobehub/settings.json` |

Priority: `LOBEHUB_SERVER` env var > `settings.json` > default official URL.

## Shell Completion

### Install completion for a linked CLI

| Shell  | Command                        |
| ------ | ------------------------------ |
| `zsh`  | `source <(lh completion zsh)`  |
| `bash` | `source <(lh completion bash)` |

### Use completion during local development

| Shell  | Command                                      |
| ------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| `zsh`  | `source <(bun src/index.ts completion zsh)`  |
| `bash` | `source <(bun src/index.ts completion bash)` |

- Completion is context-aware. For example, `lh agent <Tab>` shows agent subcommands instead of top-level commands.
- If you update completion logic locally, re-run the corresponding `source <(...)` command to reload it in the current shell session.
- Completion only registers shell functions. It does not install the `lh` binary by itself.

## Quick Check

```bash
which lh
lh --help
lh agent <TAB>
```

## Tests

The default `test` and `test:coverage` scripts run offline unit tests only. Live
E2E uses a separate config and never replaces or removes your selected CLI home.
It always runs this checkout's `dist/index.js`, not a globally installed `lh` or
a caller-supplied `LH_CLI_PATH`.

From `apps/cli`, prepare a dedicated test account (never your everyday account):

```bash
bun run build
export LOBEHUB_CLI_HOME=.lobehub-e2e
export LOBEHUB_SERVER=https://your-test-server.example
node dist/index.js login --server "$LOBEHUB_SERVER"
node dist/index.js whoami

# Explicitly authorize real writes for this test account/server.
export LOBEHUB_E2E_ALLOW_WRITES=1
bun run test:e2e e2e/model.e2e.test.ts --testTimeout=60000 --hookTimeout=60000
```

Without a selected home, server, write opt-in, built CLI, or valid authentication,
the live setup fails before fixture creation. A directory name does not itself
isolate server data: sign in with a dedicated test identity. Model tests own a
temporary provider, including the remote-model clearing case. Other suites may
create data or consume model credits, so do not run them on a personal account.
Collection alone (`bunx vitest list --config vitest.e2e.config.mts`) needs no login.
Signal and VFS tests additionally require their documented Agent ID variables.
Search fixtures wait up to 60 seconds for asynchronous indexing; a timeout fails
the suite rather than accepting empty results. The command above supplies a live
network budget explicitly; this does not change unit-test timeouts or enable retries.
