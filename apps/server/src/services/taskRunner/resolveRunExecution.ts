 * The execution metadata a CONTINUED topic has to carry before this run.

 * A topic's own values outrank everything a later run brings: `turnSetup` stamps
 * `initialTopicMetadata` only when it CREATES the topic, `heteroDispatch`'s cwd
 * resolver reads `topic.metadata.workingDirectory` above the run's initial
 * metadata (and above the agent's per-device pick and the device default), and
 * `topic.metadata.boundDeviceId` is what project grouping and the client's
 * worktree probes read. So a task retargeted since its topic was written would
 * continue on the machine it now pins with the PREVIOUS machine's directory —
 * a path that may not exist there — while the UI kept filing the topic under the
 * old machine.
 *
 * The task's own selection is the one statement that covers EVERY run of it, so
 * mirror it onto the topic before dispatching. Axes the task does not pin are
 * CLEARED, because "inherit the agent" is a decision too: a pin the user removed
 * must stop deciding where the run goes.
 *
 * Only a task that has EVER made a selection gets that treatment. A task with no
 * `execution` block at all — every task written before this existed, and every
 * one nobody pinned — never said anything about where it runs, so its topic's
 * own device and directory stand: that is where the continued topic's CLI session
 * and cwd live, and `turnSetup` keeps routing the continuation there. Clearing
 * them would let a since-changed agent target move the run to another machine
 * and lose the session. A selection the user cleared is still persisted (as
 * `null` axes, see `toTaskExecutionConfigPatch`), so the two stay tellable apart.
 *
 * Returns `undefined` when there is nothing to write — the topic already agrees
 * (the common case: a continuation should not pay for a write it does not need)
 * or the task never selected anything.
