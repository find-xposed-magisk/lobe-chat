 * to personal scope, and a workspace agent asked to edit itself silently reads
 * and writes the wrong tenancy instead of failing.

 * Applied to EVERY command of a workspace run, deliberately not gated on
 * `isLhCommand`. The device merges this into the spawned process environment,
 * so every descendant inherits it — which is the only way to reach an `lh` the
 * command invokes indirectly: `bash -lc 'lh whoami'`, a shell script, a
 * Makefile target, an npm script. Command-position detection sees none of
 * those, and unlike the sandbox path there is nothing here worth gating: this
 * mints no credential, it exports a non-secret scope id that only the LobeHub
 * CLI reads, so setting it on a command that never calls `lh` costs nothing.
 *
 * `LOBEHUB_JWT` is deliberately NOT sent: on a personal device the stored
 * credentials already are the caller's, so it buys nothing, while a workspace
 * device belongs to another member and shipping the caller's token onto their
 * machine would be a real credential leak. Auth stays with the device; only the
 * scope travels. A device owner who is not a member of that workspace now gets
 * an explicit error rather than a silent personal-scope write.

/**
 * Detect and prepare `lh` CLI commands for execution in the cloud sandbox.
 *
 * Instead of rewriting every `lh` occurrence (which can only ever cover the
 * shell forms the regex happens to know), the command is left **byte-identical**
 * and a prelude writes an `lh` executable into a fresh directory at the front
 * of `PATH`:
 *
 * ```sh
 * __lobehub_lh_bin=$(mktemp -d) && trap 'rm -rf …' EXIT && … && cat > …/lh <<'…' && chmod 700 … && export PATH=…
 * #!/bin/sh
 * LOBEHUB_JWT='…' LOBEHUB_SERVER='…' LOBEHUB_WORKSPACE_ID='…' exec npx -y @lobehub/cli "$@"
 * …
 * (
 * <original command>
 * )
 * ```
 *
 * It has to be an executable on `PATH`, not a shell function: a function only
 * exists inside the shell that defined it, so `timeout 60 lh …`, `bash -c 'lh …'`,
 * `xargs lh` or a Python/Node subprocess — all of which exec `lh` as a program —
 * never saw it and ran the sandbox's own unauthenticated `lh` instead. `PATH`
 * is inherited by every descendant, so each of those forms resolves the same
 * credentialed wrapper, while the JWT is still emitted exactly once.
 *
 * The credentials are assignment-prefixed to `npx` INSIDE the wrapper rather
 * than `export`ed around the script. Exporting would put a full user auth token
 * in the environment of every command the model wrote, where any later `env`,
 * `echo $LOBEHUB_JWT`, `curl` or child process could read it. Only `PATH` is
 * exported; the token stays scoped to the `npx` process the wrapper execs.
 *
 * The sandbox session outlives the command, so the wrapper must not: the EXIT
 * trap deletes it once the script ends, and the command runs in a subshell so
 * its own `trap` or `exit` cannot skip that cleanup. A later command in the
 * same sandbox finds no token on disk. Jobs the command left in the background
 * (`nohup lh … &`, `(sleep 5; lh …) &`) may exec `lh` after the script ends, so
 * when there are any, a detached watcher removes the wrapper only once they
 * have all exited — without making the command itself wait for them. A job
 * detached further (`( lh … & )`, `disown`), or left behind by a command that
 * `exec`s another program (which replaces the subshell and skips its EXIT
 * trap; `exec` is a special builtin a function cannot intercept), is not
 * tracked and may lose the race. If the wrapper cannot be written, the script
 * exits before the command runs rather than letting `lh` fall through to an unauthenticated one.
 *
 * `LOBEHUB_WORKSPACE_ID` is what keeps a workspace run's CLI calls in the
 * workspace: without it the CLI resolves to personal scope and a workspace
 * agent cannot even find itself.
