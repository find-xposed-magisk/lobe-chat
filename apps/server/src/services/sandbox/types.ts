/**
 * The part of an environment's definition the execution plane acts on while a

 *
 * A deliberate pick rather than the stored object passed through. Two reasons,
 * and the first is the one that matters: `EnvironmentConfiguration` is typed
 * without credentials, but it is `jsonb` — the column accepts whatever was
 * written to it, and this object now travels to the execution plane on every
 * tool call. Naming the fields means a key that appears in the database later
 * cannot start leaving the server just because someone added it upstream.
 *
 * The second is that `bootstrapCommand` and `sources` are here even though a
 * session never runs either: they are two of the three keys the execution
 * plane digests to decide which build a snapshot belongs to. Dropping them
 * would make every session disagree with the build it restored.
