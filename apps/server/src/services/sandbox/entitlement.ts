 * selective first:
 *
 * 1. The run is the principal's own (not a share visitor's).
 * 2. Their identity yields a safe directory name.
 * 3. They opted into the `enablePersistentSandbox` lab experiment, and their
 *    plan entitles them to storage.
 *
 * Returns `null` for "no persistent workspace", which is the shape the
 * execution plane reads as free tier. Without a claim its routing sends the run
 * to the ephemeral sandbox no matter what mode the request asks for, so this is
 * the single gate for the whole feature: nothing a client sends can open it.
 *
 * Never throws: a preference or subscription lookup that fails must not take
 * the sandbox down with it. The run degrades to an ephemeral sandbox, which is
 * what every session does today.
