 * the operation either way; this only decides what the board is told about.
 *
 * - Codes that count as operational failures always go on the board.
 * - `user`-attributed codes (quota, bad key, content policy, …) stay off it.
 * - `provider`-attributed codes (rate limits, upstream outages) stay off it for a
 *   user's own provider, but go on it for ours: there they mean our upstream
 *   accounts are limited or down. When the provider is unknown they go on it too,
 *   so a lost provider can never hide an outage of ours.
 *
 * `provider` is the operation's configured provider — the one the board shows.
 * The normalized error's `body.provider` is not a substitute: for our provider it
 * names the upstream the router reached (`azure`, `google`, …), never ours.
