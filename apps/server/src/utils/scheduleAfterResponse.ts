 * Use when:
 * - One request performs several independent units of work back to back, and
 *   what one unit defers must be done before the next unit starts — e.g. the
 *   agent step loop, where each step's budget settlement has to release its
 *   hold before the next step reserves again.
 *
 * Deferred work is only captured while the async context propagates from
 * `fn`. Anything scheduled outside it keeps the ordinary post-response
 * behaviour. Node binds that context where a stream is created, so work
 * deferred from a stream callback (for example a model response's `onFinal`)
 * is captured only when the stream itself is created inside the scope. Work still running when `fn` settles is handed to the host, so
 * returning from the scope never waits for it.

 *
