# Configuring Casdoor Authentication

[Casdoor](https://casdoor.org/) is an open-source Identity Access Management (IAM) platform with web UI for SSO.

<Steps>
  ### Create Application in Casdoor

  1. Log in to your Casdoor admin console
  2. Go to **Applications** and click **Add**
  3. Configure the application:
     - Name: `LobeChat`
     - Organization: Select your organization
     - Redirect URLs: Add your callback URL

  <Callout type={'info'}>
    **Callback URL Format**: `https://your-domain.com/api/auth/callback/casdoor`
  </Callout>

  4. Save and note down the **Client ID** and **Client Secret**

  ### Get Issuer URL

  The issuer URL is your Casdoor server URL, typically: `https://your-casdoor-domain`

  ### Configure Environment Variables

  When deploying LobeChat, you need to configure the following environment variables:

  | Environment Variable             | Type     | Description                                                                   |
  | -------------------------------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
  | `AUTH_SECRET`                    | Required | Key used to encrypt session tokens. Generate using: `openssl rand -base64 32` |
  | `AUTH_SSO_PROVIDERS`             | Required | SSO provider for LobeChat. Use `casdoor` for Casdoor                          |
  | `AUTH_CASDOOR_ID`                | Required | Client ID from Casdoor application                                            |
  | `AUTH_CASDOOR_SECRET`            | Required | Client Secret from Casdoor application                                        |
  | `AUTH_CASDOOR_ISSUER`            | Required | Casdoor server URL (e.g., `https://your-casdoor-domain`)                      |

  <Callout type={'tip'}>
    Go to [📘 Environment Variables](/docs/self-hosting/environment-variables/auth#casdoor) for detailed information on these variables.
