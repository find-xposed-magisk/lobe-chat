# Deploying Server Database Version on Dokploy.

This article will detail how to deploy the server database version of LobeHub.

## 1. Preparation Work

### Configure S3 Storage Service

In the server-side database, we need to configure the S3 storage service to store files. For detailed configuration instructions, please refer to the section [Configure S3 Storage Service](https://lobehub.com/docs/self-hosting/platform/vercel#3-configure-s-3-storage-service) in the Vercel deployment guide。After the configuration is complete, you will obtain the following environment variables:

```shell
S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID=
S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=
S3_ENDPOINT=
S3_BUCKET=
S3_PUBLIC_DOMAIN=
S3_ENABLE_PATH_STYLE=
```

### Configure KEY\_VAULTS\_SECRET Environment Variable

`KEY_VAULTS_SECRET` is used to encrypt sensitive information such as API keys stored by users. Click the button below to generate:

<GenerateSecret envName="KEY_VAULTS_SECRET" />

### Configure authentication environment variables

Prepare the following authentication environment variables (powered by [Better Auth](https://www.better-auth.com)):

Click the button below to generate `AUTH_SECRET` (session encryption key):

<GenerateSecret envName="AUTH_SECRET" />

You also need to configure the `JWKS_KEY` environment variable for signing and verifying JWTs. Click the button below to generate:

<GenerateJWKSKey />

<Callout type={'info'}>
  For advanced features like SSO providers, magic link login, and email verification, see [Authentication Service](/docs/self-hosting/advanced/auth).

## 2. Deploying the database on Dokploy

Enter the previously created Project, click on Create Service, and select Database. In the Database interface, choose PostgreSQL, then set the database name, user, and password. In the Docker image field, enter `pgvector/pgvector:pg17`, and finally click Create to create the database.

Enter the created database and set an unused port in External Credentials to allow external access; otherwise, LobeHub will not be able to connect to the database. You can view the Postgres database connection URL in External Host, as shown below:

```shell
postgresql://postgres:wAbLxfXSwkxxxxxx@45.577.281.48:5432/postgres
```

Finally, click Deploy to deploy the database.
