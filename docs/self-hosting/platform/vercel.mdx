# Deploy LobeChat with Vercel

If you want to deploy LobeChat on Vercel, you can follow the steps below:

## Vercel Deployment Process

<Steps>
  ### Click the button below to deploy

  [![](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Flobehub%2Flobe-chat\&project-name=lobe-chat\&repository-name=lobe-chat)

  Simply log in with your GitHub account to complete the deployment.

  ### After deployment, you can start using it

  ### Bind a custom domain (optional)

  Vercel's assigned domain DNS may be polluted in some regions, so binding a custom domain can establish a direct connection.
</Steps>

## Automatic Synchronization of Updates

If you have deployed your project using the one-click deployment steps mentioned above, you may find that you are always prompted with "updates available." This is because Vercel creates a new project for you by default instead of forking this project, which causes the inability to accurately detect updates.

  We recommend following the [Self-Hosting Upstream Sync](/docs/self-hosting/advanced/upstream-sync)
  steps to Redeploy.
