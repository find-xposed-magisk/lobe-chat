5. After installation, enter the domain name or IP+ port set in the previous step in the browser to access.

- Name: application name, default `LobeHub-random characters`
- Version selection: default `latest`
- Domain name: If you need to access directly through the domain name, please configure the domain name here and resolve the domain name to the server
- Allow external access: If you need direct access through `IP+Port`, please check. If you have set up a domain name, please do not check here.
- Port: Default `3210`, can be modified by yourself

6. After submission, the panel will automatically initialize the application, which will take about `1-3` minutes. It can be accessed after the initialization is completed.
