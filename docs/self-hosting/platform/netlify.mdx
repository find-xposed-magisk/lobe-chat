# Deploy LobeHub with Netlify

If you want to deploy LobeHub on Netlify, you can follow these steps:

## Deploy LobeHub with Netlify

<Steps>
  ### Fork the LobeHub Repository

  Click the Fork button to fork the LobeHub repository to your GitHub account.

  ### Import to Netlify Workspace

  <Callout>
    After testing, it is currently not supported to have a one-click deployment button similar to
    Vercel/Zeabur. The reason is unknown. Therefore, manual import is required.
  </Callout>

  Click "Import from git"

  Then click "Deploy with Github" and authorize Netlify to access your GitHub account.

  ### Configure Site Name and Environment Variables

  In this step, you need to configure your site, including the site name, build command, and publish directory. Fill in your site name in the "Site Name" field. If there are no special requirements, you do not need to modify the remaining configurations as we have already set the default configurations.

  Click the "Add environment variables" button to add site environment variables if needed:

</Steps>

## Set up Custom Domain (Optional)

You can use the subdomain provided by Netlify, or choose to bind a custom domain. Currently, the domain provided by Netlify has not been contaminated, and can be accessed directly in most regions.
