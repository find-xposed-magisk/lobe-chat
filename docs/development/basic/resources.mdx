# Resources and References

The design and development of LobeHub would not have been possible without the excellent projects in the community and ecosystem. We have used or referred to some outstanding resources and guides in the design and development process. Here are some key reference resources for developers to refer to during the development and learning process:

1. **OpenAI API Guide**: We use OpenAI's API to access and process AI conversation data. You can check out the [OpenAI API Guide](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/introduction) for more details.
2. **OpenAI SDK**: We use OpenAI's Node.js SDK to interact with OpenAI's API. You can view the source code and documentation on the [OpenAI SDK](https://github.com/openai/openai-node) GitHub repository.
3. **AI SDK**: We use Vercel's AI SDK to access and process AI conversation data. You can refer to the documentation of [AI SDK](https://sdk.vercel.ai/docs) for more details.
4. **LangChain**: Our early conversation feature was implemented based on LangChain. You can visit [LangChain](https://langchain.com) to learn more about it.
5. **Chat-Next-Web**: Chat Next Web is an excellent project, and some of LobeHub's features and workflows are referenced from its implementation. You can view the source code and documentation on the [Chat-Next-Web](https://github.com/Yidadaa/ChatGPT-Next-Web) GitHub repository.
6. **Next.js Documentation**: Our project is built on Next.js, and you can refer to the [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) for more information about Next.js.
7. **FlowGPT**: FlowGPT is currently the world's largest Prompt community, and some of the agents in LobeHub come from active authors in FlowGPT. You can visit [FlowGPT](https://flowgpt.com/) to learn more about it.
