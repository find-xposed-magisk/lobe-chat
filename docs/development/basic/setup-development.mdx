# Environment Setup Guide

Welcome to the LobeHub development environment setup guide.

## Online Development

If you have access to GitHub Codespaces, you can click the button below to enter the online development environment with just one click:

## Local Development

Before starting development on LobeHub, you need to install and configure some necessary software and tools in your local environment. This document will guide you through these steps.

### Development Environment Requirements

First, you need to install the following software:

- Node.js: LobeHub is built on Node.js, so you need to install Node.js. We recommend installing the latest stable version.
- PNPM: We use PNPM as the preferred package manager. You can download and install it from the [PNPM official website](https://pnpm.io/installation).
- Bun: We use Bun as the npm scripts runner. You can download and install it from the [Bun official website](https://bun.com/docs/installation).
- Git: We use Git for version control. You can download and install it from the Git official website.
- Docker: Required for running PostgreSQL, RustFS, and other services. You can download and install it from the [Docker official website](https://www.docker.com/get-started).
- IDE: You can choose your preferred integrated development environment (IDE). We recommend using WebStorm/VSCode.

### VSCode Users

We recommend installing the extensions listed in [.vscode/extensions.json](https://github.com/lobehub/lobehub/blob/main/.vscode/extensions.json) for the best development experience.

### Project Setup

After installing the above software, you can start setting up the LobeHub project.

#### 1. Get the Code

First, you need to clone the LobeHub codebase from GitHub. Run the following command in the terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lobehub/lobehub.git
cd lobehub
```

#### 2. Install Dependencies

Use PNPM to install the project's dependencies:

```bash
pnpm i
```

#### 3. Configure Environment

Copy the example environment files:

```bash
# Docker services configuration
cp docker-compose/dev/.env.example docker-compose/dev/.env

# Next.js development server configuration
cp .env.example.development .env
```

Edit these files as needed:

- `docker-compose/dev/.env` - Docker services (PostgreSQL, Redis, RustFS, SearXNG)
- `.env` - Next.js dev server (database connection, S3 storage, auth, etc.)

#### 4. Start Docker Services

Start all required services using Docker Compose:

```bash
bun run dev:docker
```

This will start the following services:

- PostgreSQL database (port 5432)
- Redis cache (port 6379)
- RustFS storage (API port 9000, Console port 9001)
- SearXNG search (port 8180)

You can check all Docker services are running by running:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose/dev/docker-compose.yml ps
```

#### 5. Run Database Migrations

Execute the database migration script to create all necessary tables:

```bash
pnpm db:migrate
```

You should see: `✅ database migration pass.`

#### 6. Start Development Server

Launch the LobeHub development server:

```bash
bun run dev
```

Now, you can open `http://localhost:3010` in your browser, and you should see the welcome page of LobeHub. This indicates that you have successfully set up the development environment.

## Service URLs

When running with Docker Compose development setup:

- **PostgreSQL**: `postgres://postgres@localhost:5432/lobechat`
- **Redis**: `redis://localhost:6379`
- **RustFS API**: `http://localhost:9000`
- **RustFS Console**: `http://localhost:9001`
- **SearXNG**: `http://localhost:8180`
- **Application**: `http://localhost:3010`

## Troubleshooting

### Reset Services

If you encounter issues, you can reset the entire stack:

```bash
# Completely reset Docker environment (delete all data and restart)
bun run dev:docker:reset
```

### Port Conflicts

If ports are already in use:

```bash
# Check what's using the ports
lsof -i :5432  # PostgreSQL
lsof -i :6379  # Redis
lsof -i :9000  # RustFS API
lsof -i :9001  # RustFS Console
lsof -i :8180  # SearXNG
```

### Database Migrations

Run migrations manually when needed:

```bash
pnpm db:migrate
```
