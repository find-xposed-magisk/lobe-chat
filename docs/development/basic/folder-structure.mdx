# Directory Structure

The directory structure of LobeHub is as follows:

```bash

## app

The `app` directory follows Next.js 13+ App Router conventions with a sophisticated architecture using [Route Groups](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/route-groups) to organize backend services, platform variants, and application routes:

```bash
app

│   ├── api/                      # REST API endpoints

### Architecture Explanation

**Route Groups:**

- `(backend)` - Contains all server-side API routes, middleware, and backend services
- `[variants]` - Dynamic route group handling different platform variants and main application pages
- `@modal` - Parallel routes for modal dialogs using Next.js parallel routing

**Platform Organization:**

- The architecture supports multiple platforms (web, desktop, mobile) through route organization
- Desktop-specific routes are in the `desktop/` directory
- Mobile-specific routes are organized under `(main)/(mobile)/`
- Shared layouts and components are in `_layout/` directories

**API Architecture:**

- REST APIs in `(backend)/api/` and `(backend)/webapi/`
- tRPC endpoints organized by runtime environment (edge, lambda, async, desktop)
- Authentication and OIDC handling in dedicated route groups

This architecture provides clear separation of concerns while maintaining flexibility for different deployment targets and runtime environments.
