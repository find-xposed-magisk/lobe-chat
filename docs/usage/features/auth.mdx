LobeChat uses [Better Auth](https://www.better-auth.com) as its authentication solution, providing comprehensive, secure, and flexible identity verification services.

## Authentication Methods

LobeChat supports multiple authentication methods to meet diverse user needs:

### Email / Password

Traditional email and password login with secure password hashing. You can register a new account with your email address and set a password.

### Magic Link

Passwordless authentication via email magic link. Simply enter your email, click the link sent to your inbox, and you're logged in - no password required.

### Social Login (SSO)

Quick login via popular identity providers:

- **Google** - Sign in with your Google account
- **GitHub** - Sign in with your GitHub account
- **Microsoft** - Sign in with your Microsoft account
- **Apple** - Sign in with your Apple ID
- And more...

## Account Management
