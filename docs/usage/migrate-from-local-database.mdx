# Migrate from Local Database (v1.x) to Cloud (v2.x)

LobeHub v1.x Desktop supported a **local database** mode, which stored your data on this device. Starting from v2.x, we have moved to a **cloud-first architecture** and removed the local database so we can iterate faster and deliver a more consistent experience across platforms.

<Callout type="info">
  Why the change? The v1.x local database typically consumed more system resources, and only a small
  portion of users relied on it. By simplifying the client and focusing on the cloud-first
  experience, we can improve overall performance and ship new features faster.
</Callout>

This guide explains how to **export your data from v1.x** and **import it into v2.x**.

## Before you start

- Keep your **v1.x client installed** until you confirm the migration is successful.
- Prepare a **stable network connection** (importing may take time, especially for large histories).
- Sign in to **LobeHub v2.x** (Cloud or your self-hosted instance).

If you prefer self-hosting, you can follow the [Self-Hosting Guide](/docs/self-hosting/start) first, then import into your self-hosted v2.x instance.

## If you already upgraded to v2.x by accident

You can still migrate your data:

1. Download and install a **v1.x build** from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/lobehub/lobe-chat/releases).
2. Use v1.x to export your data (`Settings -> Data Storage -> Export Data`), then import it in v2.x.

Don’t worry: **upgrading to v2.x does not delete your local database files**. As long as the local database files are still there, your data is still there.

### Local database location

By default, the local database is stored at:

- `${appData}/lobehub-storage/lobehub-local-db`

## What will be migrated

The exact items depend on the export format and your v1.x build, but typically include:

- Your assistants/agents
- Conversations / topics and messages
- Prompt templates (if used in your v1.x build)
- Basic preferences and settings (when supported)

## What will NOT be migrated (common cases)

- Provider API keys and secrets (recommended to re-enter them in v2.x)
- Local-only files or cached data
- Some device-specific settings

<Callout type="warning">
  If your v1.x data contains sensitive content, keep the export file in a safe location. Do not
  share it publicly.
</Callout>

## Step 1: Export data from LobeHub v1.x

In the v1.x Desktop app:

1. Go to **Settings** → **Data Storage** → **Export Data**.
2. You will get a JSON export file (for example: `2026-01-22-10-02_LobeHub-data.json`).
3. Save the file to a location you can easily find (for example, Desktop).

### Export tips

- If you have a very large message history, consider exporting during idle time.

## Step 2: Import data into LobeHub v2.x

In any v2.x app (Desktop / Web / self-hosted):

1. Sign in to your LobeHub account.
2. Go to **Settings** → **Data Storage** → **Import Data**.
3. Upload the export JSON file from Step 1.
4. Wait for the import to complete, then refresh the page/app if needed.

## Verify your migration

After importing, check:

- Agents/assistants are present and their prompts look correct
- Recent conversations appear as expected
- Key settings (language, theme, shortcuts, etc.) are set the way you want

If anything is missing, keep the v1.x export file and retry the import after updating to the latest v2.x.

## Troubleshooting

### Import fails or gets stuck

- Confirm your network is stable and try again.
- Update to the latest v2.x and re-import.

### Some data is missing after import

- Different v1.x builds may store data slightly differently.
- If you used multiple profiles/workspaces in v1.x, export and import them separately (when supported).
