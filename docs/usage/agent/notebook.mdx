# Notebook

LobeHub offers a powerful Notebook feature that allows you to save and manage documents directly within your conversations. No more worrying about losing important information—your assistant can help you take notes, save reports, and organize research materials. Everything stays within the current topic and is always accessible. The Notebook breaks the limitations of fleeting conversations by turning valuable insights into structured, manageable documents. From meeting minutes to study notes, research reports to to-do lists, the Notebook helps you build knowledge in a more systematic and lasting way.

The Notebook serves as a topic-level document storage space. When valuable content arises during a conversation, your assistant can save it to the Notebook, creating a structured document library. These documents are linked to the current topic, making it easy to reference and revisit them in future discussions.

## What You Can Do with the Notebook

### Save Notes and Reminders

Your assistant can quickly jot down ideas, to-dos, and flashes of inspiration. Just say "Take a note for me," and the content will be saved to your Notebook.

### Organize Research Materials

When your assistant helps you search for information or analyze data, you can save the valuable findings. The next time you continue your research, everything will be right where you left it.

### Generate Reports and Articles

Your assistant can help you draft structured reports, analytical documents, or long-form articles, and save them directly to the Notebook. You can view, edit, and expand on them anytime.

### Manage Document Versions

You can ask your assistant to update existing documents by adding new content or modifying what's already there. Documents in the Notebook evolve over time, always staying up to date.

### Enable the Notebook Plugin

Notebook is a built-in plugin. You’ll need to enable it for your assistant to use document management features.

### Enable in Assistant Profile

- Go to the assistant profile page, click "+ Integrate Skills," and check "Notebook" to enable it.

### Enable in a Conversation

- In a conversation, click the skill icon below the chat box and check "Notebook" to activate it.

### Using the Notebook

You can ask your assistant to read document content:

- "Show me the notes we saved earlier"
- "What did that report say?"

To delete a document when it's no longer needed, you can either instruct your assistant to remove it or open the Notebook panel and delete it manually.

### View and Manage Documents

All saved documents appear in the Notebook panel on the right side of the topic. Click the document icon in the top-right corner to open the panel. You can:

- Browse the document list to view titles and summaries
- Click a document to view its full content
- Edit documents directly within the panel
- Click "Edit in Drafts" to sync the document with the "Drafts" section in the conversation
