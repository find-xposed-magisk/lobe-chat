# Topics

In LobeHub, each conversation with the assistant is organized into a topic. You can search, rename, favorite, or delete topics to better manage and retrieve your past conversations.

## Search Topics

On the conversation page, you can search for previous topics you've discussed with the assistant. Enter the conversation view, click "More" in the topic list, and use the search function to quickly locate the desired conversation.

## Rename Topics

You can give topics more meaningful names to make them easier to identify.

- Manual Rename: Locate the topic you want to rename, click "Rename", enter a new name, and save it.
- Smart Rename: Click "Smart Rename" on the topic you want to rename, and the system will automatically generate a suitable name based on the conversation content.

## Duplicate Topics

You can create a duplicate of any topic to preserve the original conversation while branching off into a new direction. Find the topic you want to copy and click "Duplicate". The system will create an identical copy of the topic. This is useful for exploring different discussion paths based on the same starting point.

## Favorite Topics

For important or frequently used topics, you can mark them as favorites. Click the favorite icon on the topic you want to save. Favorited topics will appear in the "Favorites" section of the topic list for quick access.

## Delete Topics

You can delete topics you no longer need. Locate the topic, click "Delete", and confirm the action. The topic will be removed from your list.

## Topic List

Topics are organized by time to help you easily find conversations from different periods.

- Favorites: Displays all your favorited topics.
- Time-Based List: Other topics are automatically grouped by their creation time. Expand a time group to view all topics from that period.

If you prefer not to use time-based grouping, you can switch to "Ungrouped" view.
