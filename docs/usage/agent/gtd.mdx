# GTD Tools

GTD Tools is a built-in plugin in LobeHub that deeply integrates the classic GTD (Getting Things Done) time management methodology into your conversational experience. Once enabled, your assistant transforms into a professional task management expert, helping you offload mental clutter and focus on what truly matters—your creativity and deep thinking. With GTD Tools, you can manage your schedule directly through natural language in conversations. Whether it's a sudden burst of inspiration, household chores, or serious work plans, your assistant can accurately record and track your progress.
