# Guide to Text-to-Speech & Speech-to-Text

LobeHub supports text and voice conversion features, allowing users to input content via speech and have AI responses read aloud using voice synthesis.

## Text-to-Speech (TTS)

To have AI read text aloud, simply highlight any content in the chat window and select `Text-to-Speech`. The AI will use a TTS model to convert the selected text into speech.

## Speech-to-Text (STT)

To input text using your voice, click the voice input option in the message box. LobeHub will convert your speech into text and insert it into the input field. Once you're done, you can send it directly to the AI.
