# Agent Teams

Sometimes, one assistant's perspective just isn't enough. Complex problems require multifaceted thinking, creative projects thrive on diverse expertise, and learning discussions benefit from multiple viewpoints. Agent Group Chat brings together multiple specialized assistants to collaborate just like in a real group chat — a translation assistant, a coding assistant, and a product manager assistant sitting around the table, each contributing their strengths to solve your problem. You're not just getting an answer — you're engaging in a conversation. Here, different perspectives collide, expertise complements one another, and the insights generated through AI collaboration go far beyond what a single assistant can offer.

Agent Group Chat is a collaborative space for multiple specialized assistants. You pose a question or task, and each assistant offers insights from their area of expertise. They can discuss, supplement, and even debate with one another.

## Limitations of a Single Assistant

- Can only analyze problems from one perspective
- Expertise is limited to its predefined role
- Lacks the richness of diverse viewpoints

## Advantages of Agent Group Chat

- Multiple assistants contribute their strengths and collaborate
- Diverse professional backgrounds lead to comprehensive solutions
- Discussions among assistants spark deeper insights
- A built-in moderator ensures orderly and focused conversations

## About the Moderator

Every Agent Group Chat includes a built-in moderator responsible for:

- Understanding your needs and assigning discussion tasks
- Coordinating the speaking order of assistants
- Summarizing the discussion and extracting key conclusions
- Keeping the conversation organized and on-topic

## Creating an Agent Group Chat

Click "Create Group" in the left sidebar to get started.

When creating a group chat, you can use existing templates or assemble your own team of AI assistants. You can also choose whether to include a moderator and select the model for the moderator.

## Configuring an Agent Group Chat

In the group chat session, use the left sidebar to select an assistant. You can easily switch their model or remove them from the group.

Also in the left sidebar, click the "Add Member" button to bring additional assistants into the group chat.

Go to "Group Profile" in the left sidebar to edit the group prompt, add plugins, or change the moderator model. You can also use the Agent Builder on the right panel for intelligent group creation. Agent Builder is LobeHub’s built-in assistant — simply chat with it, describe your needs, and it will automatically generate a complete group chat configuration, including group settings, system prompts, and plugin setup.
