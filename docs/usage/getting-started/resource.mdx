# Resource Library

The Resource Library in LobeHub is your personal knowledge hub. Documents uploaded during conversations, AI-generated images, and created drafts are all collected here. It strengthens your collaboration with AI by centralizing your knowledge, making it easier to manage and access anytime.

## Sources of Resources

- Conversation Uploads: Files uploaded during chats with assistants are automatically saved to the Resource Library. For example, if you upload a PDF for summarization, the file will be stored and available for future use.
- AI-Generated Content: Images created in the drawing module are automatically saved to the Resource Library. You can view, download, and reuse them in conversations or drafts at any time.
- Manual Uploads: You can directly upload files or folders to the Resource Library to actively build your knowledge base. Supported formats include documents, images, videos, audio, and more.
- Draft Creation: Drafts created in the writing module are also stored in the Resource Library for unified management alongside other resources.
- Notion Import: You can import content from Notion into the LobeHub Resource Library, enabling seamless knowledge management across platforms.
- Accessing the Resource Library: Click the "Resources" icon at the bottom of the left sidebar on the LobeHub main interface to enter the Resource Library.

## Creating a Resource Library

You can organize your Resource Library by theme, project, type, and more. Creating separate libraries helps keep your resources well-structured.

Click "New Library" in the left panel of the Resource Library page, enter a name, add an optional description, and click "Create" to get started.

### Uploading Folders

Choose to upload a folder to batch upload all files within it.

### Connecting Notion

Select and export documents from Notion, then import the Notion ZIP file via the "Connect Notion" page. Once imported, you can continue editing these documents within LobeHub.

## Managing the Resource Library

File Chunking: This process splits long documents into smaller text segments and vectorizes each one. It enables the AI assistant to better understand and retrieve relevant content.

After chunking:

- When you ask a question, the AI can quickly locate the relevant parts of a document instead of processing the entire file.
- Vectorization allows the AI to grasp the semantic meaning of the text, not just match keywords.
- The AI only processes relevant chunks, resulting in faster and more accurate responses.

### Batch Operations

Select multiple files and open the menu in the top-right corner to perform batch operations, including moving files to a library, chunking, or deleting them in bulk.

### Cross-Feature Collaboration

- Chat + Resource Library: Reference resources during conversations so the assistant can provide answers based on your knowledge.
- Drafts + Resource Library: Use materials from the Resource Library while writing to enhance content creation efficiency.
- Drawing + Resource Library: Save generated images to the Resource Library for centralized management of all visual assets.
