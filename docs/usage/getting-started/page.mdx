# Docs

LobeHub offers a professional writing space designed to help you focus on long-form content creation. Whether you're working on technical documentation, study notes, project proposals, or blog posts, the Docs feature has you covered. It supports Markdown formatting, provides real-time preview, and automatically saves every edit.

You can summon the AI assistant at any time to help with writing. The assistant does more than just offer suggestions—it can directly edit your content, polish your writing, add paragraphs, improve structure, and insert examples.

## Understanding the Docs Feature

Docs is LobeHub’s built-in writing environment, tailored for long-form writing and editing. Unlike the chat feature, Docs provides:

- A persistent writing space: Each document exists independently, allowing you to return and continue editing at any time. Your content is saved permanently.
- Structured content organization: Full Markdown support lets you organize your content with headings, lists, code blocks, quotes, and more—perfect for creating professional documents.
- Flexible file management: Create, import, rename, duplicate—comprehensive file management tools help you efficiently organize all your documents.

### Creating and Importing Docs

## Create a New Document

From the LobeHub main interface, go to “Docs” and click “New Document,” or use the dropdown menu from the new file icon on the homepage to quickly create one. Once created, you can start writing immediately. Your work is auto-saved, so you can close it anytime and pick up where you left off later.

### Import a Markdown File

If you already have a Markdown document, you can import it directly. In the Docs section, click “Upload Markdown File,” select your file, and it will be loaded into a new document for immediate editing.

### Editing Documents

Docs are edited using Markdown. Markdown is a lightweight markup language that uses simple symbols to format text, allowing you to focus on content. You can also add an icon to your document, which will appear before the title.

### Command Palette

While editing, press the / key to open the command palette. This is a quick-access tool that lets you insert various formatting elements with ease.

### Collaborate with Lobe AI

While editing a document, click the AI assistant icon on the right side of the editor to open the assistant panel. The panel slides in from the right and displays alongside your document, allowing you to chat with the assistant while continuing to write.

By default, the “Docs Assistant” is used—an AI assistant optimized specifically for document writing. If you need help in a specific domain, you can switch to a custom assistant you’ve created via the top-left corner of the assistant panel.

The assistant can directly edit the content within your document.

### Managing Documents

In the document list, you can rename documents, create duplicates, copy the full content, or delete them.
