# Agent

At LobeHub, you have the freedom to create and customize your own AI assistants—whether it's a translation assistant that remembers your terminology preferences, a coding assistant familiar with your programming style, or a writing assistant that understands your tone and voice. By configuring prompts, selecting models, adding plugins, and linking knowledge bases, you can build a truly personalized assistant tailored to your needs.

This guide will walk you through how to create and configure your AI assistant.

## Create a New AI Assistant

There are three ways to create a new assistant: use the Agent Builder for smart creation, build one from scratch, or quickly add one from the community. No matter which method you choose, your assistant can be fine-tuned to match your workflow.

### Smart Creation with Agent Builder

Agent Builder is LobeHub’s built-in assistant that helps you create AI assistants. Simply chat with Agent Builder and describe your needs—it will understand and automatically generate a complete assistant configuration, including role settings, system prompts, and plugin setup.

- Click the "Create Agent" button in the left sidebar on the homepage, or use the "Create Agent" option below the chat box.
- On the assistant profile page, chat with Agent Builder on the right side to describe your needs and complete the smart creation process.
- After the assistant is generated, you can still manually fine-tune the settings.

### Create a Custom Assistant

Custom assistants offer the highest level of personalization. You can set the assistant’s avatar, name, prompts, preferred AI model, and plugins to create a truly unique AI assistant. All customization can be done manually on the assistant profile page.

### Add from the Community

If you want a ready-to-use assistant with a complete configuration, you can add one directly from the community. The community offers a wide variety of high-quality assistants—design experts, coding helpers, copywriters, academic mentors, and more—ready to use with a single click.

- Go to "Community" → "Assistants" in the left sidebar, or scroll down the main interface to find "Community Assistants."
- Choose an assistant, click to view its details, and then click "Add Assistant and Start Chat" to add it.

### Configure Your AI Assistant

Once your assistant is created, you can enhance its capabilities by adding plugins and linking external workflows. Plugins provide extended functionality, while external workflows allow the assistant to access and interact with your favorite tools. These enhancements can significantly improve your productivity.

### Edit Assistant Information

You can edit any assistant information at any time to keep it aligned with your evolving needs. Enter a chat with the assistant, then click "Assistant Profile" in the left sidebar to make changes.

### Add Plugins and Link Tools

Adding plugins and linking tools makes collaboration with your assistant more efficient.

Enter a chat with the assistant, then go to "Assistant Profile" → "+ Integrate Plugin" in the left sidebar.

### Link Knowledge Bases

By linking a knowledge base during a conversation, your assistant can provide more accurate and personalized responses based on your data.

In the chat interface, use the appropriate button to select and link a knowledge base.

## Manage Agents

When you have many assistants and group chats, organizing them into groups is the most intuitive way to manage them. It keeps your assistant list clean and makes switching between them easier.

### Create a Group

On the LobeHub homepage, open the assistant list menu and select "Add New Group" to create a new group.

### Move to a Group

Select an existing assistant or group chat, then click "Move to Group" to organize it. You can also create new assistants or group chats directly within a group.

### Manage Groups

If you have multiple groups, go to the assistant list or group menu and select "Manage Groups" to easily rename or reorder them.

### Pin Frequently Used Assistants

You can pin frequently used assistants to the top of the list for quicker access. Select the assistant and choose "Pin" from the menu. Pinned assistants will stay at the top of the list for easy access.

## Create a Copy

You can duplicate an assistant to create a copy. Select the assistant and choose "Create Copy" from the menu. The system will generate an identical assistant, which is useful for creating variants with different configurations.

## Delete an Assistant

If you no longer need an assistant, you can delete it. Select the assistant, choose "Delete" from the menu, and confirm the deletion to remove it.
