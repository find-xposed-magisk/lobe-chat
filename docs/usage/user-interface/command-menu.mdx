# Command Menu

The Command Menu is the quick action center of LobeHub. Instantly accessible via keyboard shortcuts, it allows you to search and execute various actions without navigating through multiple interface layers. This makes navigation and operations faster and more efficient.

The Command Menu supports fuzzy search, so you don’t need to type the full name—just a few keywords will do. For example, typing "programming" will bring up "Python Programming Assistant." When frequently switching between assistants, using the Command Menu is much faster than browsing through the sidebar.

## Open the Command Menu

Use the following keyboard shortcuts to open the Command Menu:\
macOS: Cmd + K\
Windows/Linux: Ctrl + K\
The Command Menu will appear as an overlay in the center of the screen.

You can search for assistant names to quickly switch sessions, enter topic keywords to jump to past conversations, or quickly access sections like Settings, Documents, and Library. You can also search for plugins, files, and more. The Command Menu supports command search as well, allowing you to quickly perform actions like creating a new assistant or starting a conversation with AI.
