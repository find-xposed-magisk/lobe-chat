# Using GitHub Models in LobeHub

<Image cover src={'/blog/assetsf117203c39294f45930785d85773c83e.webp'} />

[GitHub Models](https://github.com/marketplace/models) is a new feature recently launched by GitHub, designed to provide developers with a free platform to access and experiment with various AI models. GitHub Models offers an interactive sandbox environment where users can test different model parameters and prompts to observe the model's responses. The platform supports a range of advanced language models, including OpenAI's GPT-4o, Meta's Llama 3.1, and Mistral's Large 2, covering a wide spectrum of use cases from large language models to task-specific models.

This guide will walk you through how to use GitHub Models within LobeHub.

## GitHub Models Rate Limits

Currently, usage of the Playground and free API is subject to limits on requests per minute, daily requests, tokens per request, and concurrent requests. If you hit a rate limit, you’ll need to wait for it to reset before making additional requests. Rate limits vary depending on the model type (low, high, or embedding models). For details on model types, refer to the GitHub Marketplace.

<Callout type="note">
  These limits are subject to change. For the most up-to-date information, please refer to the [official GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/github-models/prototyping-with-ai-models#rate-limits).

## GitHub Models Configuration Guide

<Steps>
  ### Step 1: Obtain a GitHub Access Token

  <Callout type={"warning"}>
    - During the GitHub Models testing phase, you must apply to join the [waitlist](https://github.com/marketplace/models/waitlist/join) to gain access.

    ```
    - Be sure to store your access token securely, as it will only be shown once. If you lose it, you’ll need to generate a new one.
    ```
