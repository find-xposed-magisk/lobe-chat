[Qwen](https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen1.5) is an open-source large language model (LLM) developed by Alibaba Cloud. It is officially described as an evolving AI model that achieves more accurate Chinese language understanding through extensive training data.

Now, thanks to LobeHub’s integration with [Ollama](https://ollama.com/), you can easily use the Qwen model locally within LobeHub.

This guide will walk you through how to use the locally deployed Qwen model in LobeHub:

<Steps>
  ### Install Ollama Locally

  First, you’ll need to install Ollama. For installation instructions, refer to the [Ollama usage guide](/en/docs/usage/providers/ollama).

  ### Pull the Qwen Model Using Ollama

  Once Ollama is installed, you can pull the Qwen model locally. For example, to pull the 14b version of the model, run:

  ```bash
  ollama pull qwen:14b
  ```
