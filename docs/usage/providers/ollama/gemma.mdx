[Gemma](https://blog.google/technology/developers/gemma-open-models/) is an open-source large language model (LLM) developed by Google. It is designed to be a general-purpose and flexible model for a wide range of natural language processing (NLP) tasks. Now, thanks to LobeHub’s integration with [Ollama](https://ollama.com/), you can easily use Google Gemma directly within LobeHub.

This guide will walk you through how to use the Google Gemma model in LobeHub:

<Steps>
  ### Install Ollama Locally

  First, you’ll need to install Ollama. For installation instructions, refer to the [Ollama usage guide](/en/docs/usage/providers/ollama).

  ### Pull the Google Gemma Model Using Ollama

  Once Ollama is installed, you can pull the Google Gemma model locally. For example, to pull the 7b model, run the following command:

  ```bash
  ollama pull gemma
  ```
