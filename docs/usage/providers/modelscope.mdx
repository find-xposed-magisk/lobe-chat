# ModelScope Provider Configuration

ModelScope is an open-source AI model community by Alibaba, offering access to a wide range of AI models. This guide will walk you through setting up the ModelScope provider in LobeHub.

## Prerequisites

Before using the ModelScope API, you need to:

1. **Create a ModelScope Account**

   - Visit [ModelScope](https://www.modelscope.cn/)
   - Sign up for an account

2. **Link Your Alibaba Cloud Account**

   - **Important**: Accessing the ModelScope API requires linking your Alibaba Cloud account
   - Go to your [ModelScope Access Token Page](https://www.modelscope.cn/my/myaccesstoken)
   - Follow the instructions to link your Alibaba Cloud account
   - This step is mandatory for API access

3. **Obtain an API Token**
   - After linking your Alibaba Cloud account, generate an API token
   - Copy the token for use in LobeHub

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

Add the following environment variables to your `.env` file:

```bash
# Enable ModelScope provider
ENABLED_MODELSCOPE=1

# ModelScope API key (required)
MODELSCOPE_API_KEY=your_modelscope_api_token

# Optional: Custom model list (comma-separated)
MODELSCOPE_MODEL_LIST=deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3-0324,Qwen/Qwen3-235B-A22B

# Optional: Proxy URL (if needed)
MODELSCOPE_PROXY_URL=https://your-proxy-url
```

### Docker Configuration

If you're using Docker, add the ModelScope environment variables to your `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
environment:
  - ENABLED_MODELSCOPE=1
  - MODELSCOPE_API_KEY=your_modelscope_api_token
  - MODELSCOPE_MODEL_LIST=deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3-0324,Qwen/Qwen3-235B-A22B
```

## Available Models

ModelScope provides access to a variety of models, including:

- **DeepSeek Models**: DeepSeek-V3, DeepSeek-R1 series
- **Qwen Models**: Qwen3 series, Qwen2.5 series
- **Llama Models**: Meta-Llama-3 series
- **Other Models**: Various open-source models

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Please link your Alibaba Cloud account first" error**

   - This means your Alibaba Cloud account is not yet linked to ModelScope
   - Visit the [ModelScope Access Token Page](https://www.modelscope.cn/my/myaccesstoken)
   - Complete the account linking process

2. **401 Unauthorized Error**

   - Check if your API token is correct
   - Ensure the token has not expired
   - Verify that your Alibaba Cloud account is properly linked

3. **Model Unavailable**
   - Some models may require additional permissions
   - Check the model's page on ModelScope for access requirements

### Debug Mode

Enable debug mode to view detailed logs:

```bash
DEBUG_MODELSCOPE_CHAT_COMPLETION=1
```

## Notes

- The ModelScope API is compatible with the OpenAI API format
- This service is primarily designed for users in China

## Model ID Format

ModelScope uses a namespace-prefixed format for model IDs, for example:

```
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3-0324
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528
Qwen/Qwen3-235B-A22B
Qwen/Qwen3-32B
```

When configuring the model list, be sure to use the full model ID format.

## API Limitations

- The ModelScope API is subject to rate limits
- Some models may require special permissions
- It's recommended to monitor API usage in production environments
- Certain advanced models may require a paid subscription to access
