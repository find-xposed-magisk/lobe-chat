# Submit Your Agent

If you've created a high-quality Agent, you can submit it to the marketplace and share it with users around the world.

If this is your first time submitting an Agent, you'll need to [create a community profile](/docs/usage/community/become-a-creator) first. This allows you to manage your submissions and published content within the community.

Once you're a registered creator, go to the Agent you want to publish, open its "Agent Profile," and click "Share Assistant to Community."

After your submission is reviewed and approved, your Agent will appear in the marketplace, available to users worldwide. LobeHub welcomes all users to join this ever-growing ecosystem and take part in the continuous improvement and evolution of assistants. Together, we can build a diverse, practical, and innovative collection of tools that enrich the assistant experience for everyone.
