## Installing Custom Plugins

If you'd like to install a plugin that isn't available in the LobeHub Plugin Store—such as one you've developed yourself—you can do so by clicking on "Custom Plugin":

LobeHub's plugin system is also compatible with ChatGPT plugins, allowing you to install them with a single click.
