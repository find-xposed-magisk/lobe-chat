## Assignment Rules

### Priority Order (apply in order)

1. **Specific feature owner** - e.g., `feature:knowledge-base` → @RiverTwilight
2. **Platform owner** - e.g., `platform:mobile` → @sudongyuer
3. **Provider owner** - e.g., `provider:*` → @tjx666
4. **Component owner** - e.g., 💄 Design → @canisminor1990
5. **Infrastructure owner** - e.g., `deployment:*` → @nekomeowww
6. **Default assignee** - @arvinxx for general/uncategorized issues

### Special Cases

**Multiple labels with different owners:**

- Mention the **most specific** feature owner first
- Mention secondary owners if their input is valuable
- Example: `feature:knowledge-base` + `deployment:server` → @RiverTwilight (primary), @nekomeowww (secondary)

**Priority:high issues:**

- Mention feature owner + @arvinxx
- Example: `priority:high` + `feature:image` → @tjx666 @arvinxx

**No clear owner:**

- Assign to @arvinxx for general issues

**MCP marketplace listing/submission requests — do NOT mention (auto-handled):**

Requests to **add / submit / list a new MCP server** to the marketplace are now processed automatically by the **MCP Submission Handler** workflow (it redirects installable servers to the self-service CLI and closes them, and labels remote-only servers `mcp:remote` for manual review). For these, **do NOT post any @mention comment — apply labels only.**

- Recognize them by: titles like `[Request] Add <name> to the MCP marketplace`, `[MCP] Add/Submit <name>`, `[MCP Submission] …`, `[MCP Plugin] …`; the body asks to list/index a specific MCP server and links its repo or endpoint.
- This does **NOT** apply to the following — they still get a normal @mention:
  - Bugs about the marketplace pipeline or an existing listing — e.g. "scoring stuck", "shows outdated version", "rescan/re-index listing", "not syncing". → `@ONLY-yours @arvinxx`
  - Feature requests about the marketplace product itself (search, catalog browser, etc.). → `@ONLY-yours`
