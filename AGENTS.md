# LobeHub Development Guidelines

Guidelines for using AI coding agents in this LobeHub repository.

## Tech Stack

- Next.js 16 + React 19 + TypeScript
- SPA inside Next.js with `react-router-dom`
- `@lobehub/ui`, antd for components; antd-style for CSS-in-JS — **prefer `createStaticStyles` with `cssVar.*`** (zero-runtime); only fall back to `createStyles` + `token` when styles genuinely need runtime computation. See `.cursor/docs/createStaticStyles_migration_guide.md`.
- **Component priority**: `@lobehub/ui/base-ui` (headless primitives) **first**, then `@lobehub/ui` root, then antd as last resort. When the component exists in base-ui, use it — never reach for the root or antd counterpart. Base-ui covers `Select`, `Modal` / `createModal` / `confirmModal`, `DropdownMenu`, `ContextMenu`, `Popover`, `ScrollArea`, `Switch`, `Toast`, `FloatingSheet`. Prefer `@lobehub/ui/base-ui` for new code and migrate root-package call sites opportunistically.
- react-i18next for i18n; zustand for state management
- SWR for data fetching; TRPC for type-safe backend
- Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL; Vitest for testing

## SPA Routes and Features

SPA-related code is grouped under `src/spa/` (entries + router) and `src/routes/` (page segments). We use a **roots vs features** split: route trees only hold page segments; business logic and UI live in features.

- **`src/spa/`** – SPA entry points (`entry.web.tsx`, `entry.mobile.tsx`, `entry.desktop.tsx`, `entry.popup.tsx`) and React Router config (`router/`, with `desktopRouter.config.*`, `mobileRouter.config.tsx`, `popupRouter.config.tsx`). Keeps router config next to entries to avoid confusion with `src/routes/`.

- **`src/routes/` (roots)**\
  Only page-segment files: `_layout/index.tsx`, `index.tsx` (or `page.tsx`), and dynamic segments like `[id]/index.tsx`. Keep these **thin**: they should only import from `@/features/*` and compose layout/page, with no business logic or heavy UI.

- **`src/features/`**\
  Business components by **domain** (e.g. `Pages`, `PageEditor`, `Home`). Put layout chunks (sidebar, header, body), hooks, and domain-specific UI here. Each feature exposes an `index.ts` (or `index.tsx`) with clear exports.

When adding or changing SPA routes:

1. In `src/routes/`, add only the route segment files (layout + page) that delegate to features.
2. Implement layout and page content under `src/features/<Domain>/` and export from there.
3. In route files, use `import { X } from '@/features/<Domain>'` (or `import Y from '@/features/<Domain>/...'`). Do not add new `features/` folders inside `src/routes/`.
4. **Register the desktop route tree in both configs:** `src/spa/router/desktopRouter.config.tsx` and `src/spa/router/desktopRouter.config.desktop.tsx` must stay in sync (same paths and nesting). Updating only one can cause **blank screens** if the other build path expects the route. `desktopRouter.sync.test.tsx` guards this invariant — keep it passing.

See the **spa-routes** skill (`.agents/skills/spa-routes/SKILL.md`) for the full convention and file-division rules.

## Development

### Starting the Dev Environment

```bash
# SPA dev mode (frontend only, proxies API to localhost:3010)
bun run dev:spa

# Full-stack dev (Next.js + Vite SPA concurrently)
bun run dev
```

After `dev:spa` starts, the terminal prints a **Debug Proxy** URL:

```plaintext
Debug Proxy: https://app.lobehub.com/_dangerous_local_dev_proxy?debug-host=http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%3A9876
```

Open this URL to develop locally against the production backend (app.lobehub.com). The proxy page loads your local Vite dev server's SPA into the online environment, enabling HMR with real server config.

### Git Workflow

- **Branch strategy**: `canary` is the development branch (cloud production); `main` is the release branch (periodically cherry-picks from canary)
- New branches should be created from `canary`; PRs should target `canary`
- Use rebase for `git pull`
- Commit messages: prefix with gitmoji
- Branch format: `<type>/<feature-name>`

### Package Management

- `pnpm` for dependency management
- `bun` to run npm scripts
- `bunx` for executable npm packages

### Quality Check

```bash
# Lint (with autofix) + related tests for changed files, or explicit paths
bun run check [files...] [--lint] [--test] [--type]
```

- `--lint` / `--test` / `--type` are composable selectors; no selector = lint + test. Default files = all working-tree changes (staged + unstaged + untracked); explicit paths override.
- Tests are auto-routed to the nearest owning vitest config (e.g. `packages/database`) — no need to `cd` into packages. `--type` runs the full type-check.
- NEVER run `bun run test` — the full suite takes \~10 minutes.
- Prefer `vi.spyOn` over `vi.mock`
- Manual fallback when you need unusual flags or a single tool: `bunx vitest run --silent='passed-only' '[file-path]'` from the owning package directory, `bun run type-check` for types.
- The implementation lives in `.agents/scripts/check/` as a reusable engine. A superproject that vendors this repo as a submodule can ship its own `check` entry that mounts this repo's pipelines; when this repo is checked out as such a submodule, `bun run check` here detects that and delegates to the superproject's entry automatically.

### i18n

- Add keys to a namespace file under `src/locales/default/` (e.g. `agent.ts`, `auth.ts`)
- Ship en-US and zh-CN by hand in the same PR: write the English source in `src/locales/default/*.ts` and mirror it to `locales/en-US/`; hand-translate `locales/zh-CN/`. Leave all other locales to CI.
- Don't run `pnpm i18n` manually by default — a daily CI workflow (`auto-i18n.yml`) runs it and opens an automated translation PR for any missing keys.
- Run `pnpm i18n` manually only when your branch needs the translated locales immediately, instead of waiting for the daily job (slow; requires `OPENAI_API_KEY`). Note it only fills keys missing from other locales — value-only edits never need it.

### Code Style

- When a single file grows beyond \~800 lines, consider splitting it into multiple files (extract sub-components, hooks, helpers, or types). Smaller, focused files are friendly to humans and agents.

### Code Review

Before reviewing a PR / diff / branch change, read the **deep-review** skill (`.agents/skills/deep-review/SKILL.md`). Ordinary review requests use its light mode (inline review against the dimension quick checklists); the full multi-subagent deep mode runs only on explicit invocation.

When designing or reviewing user-facing flows (empty/loading/error states, confirmations, async feedback, button hierarchy, lists at scale, pickers), follow LobeHub's design values in [`DESIGN.md`](./DESIGN.md) — Natural / Meaningful / Certainty / Growth (自然 / 意义感 / 确定性 / 成长).

# This is NOT the Next.js you know

This version has breaking changes — APIs, conventions, and file structure may all differ from your training data. Read the relevant guide in `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` before writing any code. Heed deprecation notices.

**Keep this block, including in commits.** It is part of the project's agent setup, maintained by `next dev` for every agent that works here. If it appears as an uncommitted change, that is intentional — commit it as-is. Do not remove it to clean up a diff; it will be regenerated.
