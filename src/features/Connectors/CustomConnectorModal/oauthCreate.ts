 * Create an OAuth connector and drive its authorize flow in the popup DevModal
 * opened (or the native desktop window).
 *
 * When the flow cannot even start (discovery failed, registration rejected, …)
 * nothing can have been authorized, so the row this attempt created is rolled
 * back instead of leaving a disconnected, tool-less connector behind — the same
 * `isNew` guard as the non-OAuth path, so a pre-existing connector is never
 * deleted. Once the popup is navigated the row is kept: a "dismissed" result may
 * still hide a successful callback whose status message was lost — providers
 * whose COOP policy severs `window.opener` (e.g. Stripe) always lose it. For a
 * fresh row only the callback can mark it connected, so the server state
 * decides between success and a real cancel.
