 * Those trailing workflow segments fold into the process alongside the leading
 * reasoning/tools so the answer text stays visible, rather than disappearing
 * inside the fold whenever a turn happens to end on a tool call. Everything that
 * is not the final answer — leading tools/reasoning/intermediate prose and any
 * trailing bookkeeping tools — folds under the Codex-style "已处理 {duration}"
 * header. A turn with no answer segment at all has no final answer to surface.
