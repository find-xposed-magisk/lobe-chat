/**
 * The conversation-list read every rendering surface shares.
 *
 * It asks for projected tool payloads (`@lobechat/tool-view-model`) only for a
 * protocol-v2 client whose runs execute on the server. Both halves matter:
 *
 * - Protocol v2 is what the projection ships with, so it moves with the same
 *   rollout dial rather than reaching everyone the moment this code deploys.
 * - Gateway mode is the correctness half. Off it, the run executes in the
 *   browser and assembles its LLM context from the very list this read fills
 *   (`dbMessagesMap` → `ClientMessageTransport`), so a projected tool result
 *   would silently vanish from the model's view of its own work. Whole payloads
 *   are the answer that cannot lose data, so that is what an unknown or
 *   client-side agent gets.
 *
 * The choice deliberately stays out of the message-list cache key: a list
 * cached while Gateway mode was on can still be read by a run the user has
 * since switched to the browser, which is why `ClientMessageTransport` refills
 * omitted payloads before building a context rather than trusting this gate.
