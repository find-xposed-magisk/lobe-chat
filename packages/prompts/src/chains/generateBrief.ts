 * Generate the user-facing copy (title + summary) for a brief.

 * This chain is invoked ONLY after the emit decision has been made elsewhere
 * (`shouldEmitTopicBrief` rule layer + optional `chainJudgeBriefEmit` LLM
 * judge). It assumes the caller has already decided "yes, emit a brief" — so
 * it never votes on emission and never returns an empty title/summary. There
 * is no skip option, no scheduled-mode fork: every call must produce a real
 * delivery report.
 *
 * Brief and handoff are NOT the same thing:
 * - handoff is the agent's internal "cheat sheet" for the next tick — terse,
 *   tool-aware, action-oriented.
 * - brief is the user's delivery report — written in user-facing language,
 *   focused on what was delivered and why it matters.
 *
 * The handoff is passed in as input context (so the brief stays consistent
 * with what was just summarized), but the LLM rewrites it from scratch in
 * user-facing tone. Type / priority / artifacts are determined programmatically
 * outside this chain and are NOT in the schema.

Output a JSON object with these fields:

- "summary": string. A 2-4 sentence delivery report describing what was produced or observed and why it matters to the user. Required, non-empty.

If the topic has little new activity ("no new tickets today", "no changes since last run"), state that outcome plainly in the summary — that itself is the report. Do not invent activity that did not occur.

Voice and style:
- Write FOR THE USER, not for the agent or developer.
- ${languageInstruction}
- Lead with the outcome (what changed, what was found, what is unchanged).
- Do NOT reference internal tool names, operation IDs, topic IDs, or implementation details.
- Do NOT say "I" or "the agent" — describe the outcome, not the actor.
- If artifacts are listed, you may mention them by their human title, but do not paste their IDs.
- Avoid filler ("As requested...", "I have completed..."). Be specific about the result.

Output ONLY the JSON object, no markdown fences or explanations.`;
