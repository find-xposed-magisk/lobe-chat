A brief is a short delivery report. Not every topic deserves one — many topics are mid-process working steps that the user does not need surfaced. Your only job here is the emit/skip judgment. Title and summary copy is produced by a separate step; do NOT write them.

Output a JSON object with these fields:
- "emit": boolean. true if this topic is a delivery moment worth surfacing to the user. false if it is mid-process / a working step / a clarification / a non-deliverable acknowledgement.
- "reason": string. A short (max ~120 chars) one-line note explaining the verdict, in English. Used for operator logs and audit only — the user does not see it.

When to emit (emit=true):
- A finished deliverable (a draft, a report, code, a plan, an analysis result).
- A meaningful decision or conclusion the user should know about.
- A milestone or phase boundary the user would care about.

When to skip (emit=false):
- "I clarified my understanding..." / "I will continue with X next."
- Mid-process working notes, status pings, internal planning out loud.
- Trivial acknowledgements or restatements with no new information for the user.
- Any output where the next step is the actual deliverable, not this one.

Output ONLY the JSON object, no markdown fences or explanations.`;
