 * CLI planning contract; v4 adds the takeover turn, where the coordinator hands
 * over a problem it could not route instead of stopping the Goal on a person.
 * v5 asks each planned task to declare what it builds on (`dependsOn`), so a
 * multi-round Goal reads as a progression instead of one flat row of tasks.
 * v6 adds durable waits and continuation feedback after measured shortfalls.
 * v7 sends the turn as one `<goalTurn>` block — why it started, how the previous
 * turn ended, and only the review feedback new since then, with the repeating
 * contract in `<instruction>` — so the client renders it as a card instead of a
 * wall of identical text every turn.
 * v8 lets an escalation carry an `ask` — the owner's question with concrete
 * answers (and, on a takeover, what each answer does to the blocked Task).
