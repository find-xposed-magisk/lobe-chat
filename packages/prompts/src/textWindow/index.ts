 * One truncation contract for every place that shows the model part of a long text: attachment

 *
 * Borrowed from how Claude Code, Codex, opencode and pi handle long reads:
 * - cut on line boundaries, bounded by both a line count and a character budget;
 * - always tell the model the full size and the exact range it received;
 * - end with the exact call that reads the next window, so the model can load progressively
 *   instead of guessing or asking the user to paste the rest;
 * - say so explicitly when the stored text is itself shorter than the original, because paging can
 *   never reach content that was not stored.
