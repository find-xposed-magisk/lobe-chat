 * What a tool message without a projector gets.
 *
 * The body is the MODEL's copy of the result. On screen it reaches exactly two
 * surfaces, both of which open on demand and both of which now hydrate: the
 * fallback renderer and the raw/debug viewer. No collapsed row reads it —
 * inspectors take `result.error` and the settled-ness of `result`, never its
 * content — so dropping it costs the list nothing.
 *
 * `pluginState` is deliberately NOT touched here. It is read far outside the
 * expanded card: the collapsed row's own chips, `getBuiltinRenderDisplayControl`
 * deciding whether a card auto-opens, and whole-list selectors
 * (`selectTodosFromMessages`, `selectActivatedToolIdsFromMessages`,
 * `selectActivatedSkillsFromMessages`). Those run before any expansion, so
 * "fetch it back on open" cannot cover them — which is exactly what a per-tool
 * projector is for: it knows which state keys the collapsed row needs.
