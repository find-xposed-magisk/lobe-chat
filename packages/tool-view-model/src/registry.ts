 * Deliberately a static literal rather than the `register*()` pattern the
 * client-side render registry uses: this map is read from the server read path,
 * where there is no app bootstrap to guarantee registration ran first.
 *
 * A tool missing from here still has its BODY dropped — see
 * `BODY_ONLY_PROJECTION` — and keeps its `pluginState` whole. An entry here is
 * how a tool additionally sheds state, which needs per-tool knowledge of the
 * keys its collapsed row reads.
 *
 * Before adding one, check that the tool's row does NOT open by itself:
 * `needExpand` is `renderDisplayControl !== 'collapsed'`, so a tool whose
 * manifest declares `expand` / `alwaysExpand` mounts its card on every
 * conversation load — and a projection that hydrates on expansion would then
 * cost a round trip per row instead of saving anything.
