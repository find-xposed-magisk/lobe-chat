 * (unreadable from a scheduled tick) the way the chat composer's equivalent
 * does. Stored on the task row, it is read by `TaskRunnerService.runTask` and
 * handed to the run itself.
 *

 * behaves exactly as tasks did before this existed — the assignee agent's own
 * execution target and working directory decide. Clearing a field returns that
 * axis to inheritance; it never means "run nowhere".
 *
 * Only the device axis is expressed as a pin. The run contract routes a device
 * by id (`requestedDeviceId` forces device routing unless the agent's policy is
 * `fixed`), and deliberately has no way to force the cloud sandbox, so a task
 * can pin a machine but cannot override an agent's stored target to `sandbox`.
