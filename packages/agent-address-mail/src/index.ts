/**
 * Agent Mail (lobe.id) transport — the provider behind an agent's own `mail`
 * address.
 *
 * This package knows only how to talk to Agent Mail and how to turn an email
 * into a normalized message: REST client, webhook signature verification, raw
 * header loop protection, quoted-history stripping, and markdown → HTML/text
 * rendering. It deliberately implements **no** chat-SDK adapter and carries no
 * platform identity/thread/typing semantics — an agent's address is its own,
 * not a bot inside someone else's platform.
