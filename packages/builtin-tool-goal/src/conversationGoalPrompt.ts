/**
 * Instructions injected into a heterogeneous agent's context (Claude Code,

 * Those agents never receive the builtin goal tool: they run the `lh` CLI in

export const conversationGoalPrompt = `The user sent this request with LobeHub's /goal command (the prefix was removed before it reached you; it is not your own /goal command). They are asking you to turn the request into a long-running LobeHub Goal that you supervise from this conversation, not to do the work yourself in this run.

1. Draft the goal from the user's request, in the user's language: a short title, the requirement, and one concrete, checkable acceptance criterion per explicit requirement. Do not add requirements the user did not ask for.
2. Create it bound to this conversation (the LOBEHUB_* environment already identifies you and this conversation):
   lh goal create "<title>" --conversation -r "<requirement>" -i "<the user's ask in their words>" --criterion "<criterion>" --criterion "<criterion>" --json
   The output contains goal.id and turnToken. You are now the goal's supervising agent, and this run is its first planning turn.
3. Plan it now from the goal graph already printed by lh goal create (do not run lh goal show or other lh goal commands: this run's credentials only allow creating this goal and submitting its plan). Write a JSON plan file and submit it once:
   lh goal plan <goalId> --token <turnToken> --file <path> --json
   Plan schema: {"action":"tasks","reason":"evidence-based rationale","tasks":[{"title":"specific task","description":"self-contained contract: inputs, output and acceptance"}]}
   Plan bounded, independent tasks; the goal's coordinator dispatches and runs them under the goal budget.
4. Then end the run with one or two sentences in the user's language: the goal is running, and what the first tasks are.

Do not execute, preview or self-check the tasks, mark them complete, change budgets, or claim the goal is achieved. Later planning turns continue in this conversation once tasks deliver.`;
