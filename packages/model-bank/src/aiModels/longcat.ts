      'The LongCat-Flash-Lite model has been officially released. It adopts an efficient Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture, with 68.5 billion total parameters and approximately 3 billion activated parameters. Through the use of an N-gram embedding table, it achieves highly efficient parameter utilization, and it is deeply optimized for inference efficiency and specific application scenarios. Compared to models of a similar scale, its core features are as follows:Outstanding Inference Efficiency: By leveraging the N-gram embedding table to fundamentally alleviate the I/O bottleneck inherent in MoE architectures, combined with dedicated caching mechanisms and kernel-level optimizations, it significantly reduces inference latency and improves overall efficiency. Strong Agent and Code Performance: It demonstrates highly competitive capabilities in tool invocation and software development tasks, delivering exceptional performance relative to its model size.',

      'The LongCat-Flash-Thinking-2601 model has been officially released. As an upgraded reasoning model built on a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture, it features a total of 560 billion parameters. While maintaining strong competitiveness across traditional reasoning benchmarks, it systematically enhances Agent-level reasoning capabilities through large-scale multi-environment reinforcement learning. Compared to the LongCat-Flash-Thinking model, the key upgrades are as follows: Extreme Robustness in Noisy Environments: Through systematic curriculum-style training targeting noise and uncertainty in real-world settings, the model demonstrates outstanding performance in Agent tool invocation, Agent-based search, and tool-integrated reasoning, with significantly improved generalization. Powerful Agent Capabilities: By constructing a tightly coupled dependency graph encompassing more than 60 tools, and scaling training through multi-environment expansion and large-scale exploratory learning, the model markedly improves its ability to generalize to complex and out-of-distribution real-world scenarios. Advanced Deep Thinking Mode: It expands the breadth of reasoning via parallel inference and deepens analytical capability through recursive feedback-driven summarization and abstraction mechanisms, effectively addressing highly challenging problems.',

      'The LongCat-Flash-Chat model has been upgraded to a new version. This update involves enhancements to model capabilities only; the model name and API invocation method remain unchanged. Building upon its hallmark “extreme efficiency” and “lightning-fast response,” the new version further strengthens contextual understanding and real-world programming performance: Significantly Enhanced Coding Capabilities: Deeply optimized for developer-centric scenarios, the model delivers substantial improvements in code generation, debugging, and explanation tasks. Developers are strongly encouraged to evaluate and benchmark these enhancements. Support for 256K Ultra-Long Context: The context window has doubled from the previous generation (128K) to 256K, enabling efficient processing of massive documents and long-sequence tasks. Comprehensively Improved Multilingual Performance: Provides strong support for nine languages, including Spanish, French, Arabic, Portuguese, Russian, and Indonesian. More Powerful Agent Capabilities: Demonstrates greater robustness and efficiency in complex tool invocation and multi-step task execution.',
