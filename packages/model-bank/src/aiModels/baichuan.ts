      'We introduce Baichuan-M3, a new-generation medical-enhanced large language model designed to support clinical-grade medical assistance. In contrast to prior approaches that primarily focus on static question answering or superficial role-playing, Baichuan-M3 is trained to explicitly model the clinical decision-making process, aiming to improve usability and reliability in real-world medical practice. Rather than merely producing plausible-sounding answers, fluent doctor-like questioning, or high-frequency but vague recommendations such as “you should seek medical attention as soon as possible,” Baichuan-M3 is explicitly trained to proactively acquire critical clinical information, construct coherent medical reasoning pathways, and systematically constrain hallucination-prone behaviors throughout the decision process. This design endows the model with intrinsic medical-enhanced capabilities aligned with real clinical workflows. Across evaluations of clinical inquiry, medical hallucination robustness, HealthBench, and HealthBench-Hard, Baichuan-M3 surpasses the latest flagship model released by OpenAI, GPT-5.2, establishing a new state of the art in medical-enhanced language models.',

      "We introduce Baichuan-M2, a medically-enhanced reasoning model, designed for real-world medical reasoning tasks. We start from real-world medical questions and conduct reinforcement learning training based on a large-scale verifier system. While maintaining the model's general capabilities, the medical effectiveness of the Baichuan-M2 model has achieved a breakthrough improvement. Baichuan-M2 is the best open-source medical model in the world to date. It surpasses all open-source models, including gpt-oss-120b, as well as many cutting-edge closed-source models on the HealthBench Benchmark. It is the open-source model closest to GPT-5 in medical capabilities. Our practice demonstrates that a robust verifier is crucial for linking model capabilities to the real world and an end-to-end reinforcement learning approach fundamentally enhances the model's medical reasoning abilities. The release of Baichuan-M2 advances the cutting edge of technology in the field of medical artificial intelligence.",
