  'Extract **ALL** identity layer information from the conversation. Capture',

  'small but meaningful signals people often overlook:',
  '\n',
  '- Craft `title` as a concise honorific-style phrase that pairs strength/impact with domain or milestone (e.g., "Specializes in low-latency infra", "Cares for rescue cats", "Former Aliyun engineer", "Trusted open-source maintainer"). Avoid bare job titles.',
  '- Only set `role` when the conversation states one (e.g., "platform engineer", "caregiver"); do not invent defaults. Keep it neutral and aligned to the evidence.',
  '\n',
  '- Highlights and recognition that feel meaningful or surprising (e.g., community',
  '  support for an open-source maintainer, a sponsor, a compliment from a mentor)',
  '- Achievements and milestones that shape how the user sees themselves (career,',
  '  education, crafts, caregiving, competitions), including certifications and',
  '  awards',
  '- Emotional drivers, setbacks, and recoveries that color their self-view (e.g.,',
  '  resilience after a layoff, pride in shipping a project, joy from helping',
  '  friends)',
  '- People who matter to them and why (mentors, collaborators, friends, family,',
  '  supporters)',
  '- Roles in their life as they describe them and as others see them (profession,',
  '  vocation, community role, life stage)',
  '- Episodic identity-shaping moments: adopting a pet, landing a new freelance',
  '  job, cooking or building something unexpectedly excellent, discovering a new',
  '  talent, receiving higher-than-expected praise, or finding a new area they are',
  '  passionate about',
  '\n',
  'Maintain a concise, high-level biography that reflects lifestyle, trajectory,',
  'work domains, and current focus. Use identity entries to refine this biography',
  'over time through updates rather than duplicating facts. When the user shares',
  'struggles or vulnerabilities, describe them with human-centered, supportive',
  'language rather than cold summaries.',
  '\n',
  'Keep identity distinct from preference. Do NOT encode long-term preferences,',
  'choices, or directives inside identity descriptions; those belong to the',
  'preference layer. Identity should describe who the user is, not how the user',
  'likes others to behave. Lists of tools, stacks, or implementation techniques',
  'belong in the preference layer unless they are essential to summarizing the',
  "user's enduring roles.",
  '\n',
  'Use CRUD-style actions to keep the identity record accurate and compact. Always',
  'produce `add`, `update`, and `remove` arrays (use empty arrays when there are no',
  'actions of that type):',
  '\n',
  '- Use `withIdentities.actions.add` for genuinely new identity aspects that are',
  '  absent from the existing list, especially meaningful highlights, achievements,',
  '  people who matter, and episodic milestones that shape self-view.',
  '- Use `withIdentities.actions.update` when an existing entry changes or gains',
  '  more precision. Prefer updates over new entries to prevent duplication. If',
  '  multiple statements describe the same role or biography (e.g., repeated',
  '  "developer/engineer/test maintainer" variants), consolidate them into a single',
  '  enriched entry rather than creating parallel items.',
  '- Use `withIdentities.actions.remove` to remove incorrect, obsolete, or',
  '  duplicated entries.',
  '\n',
  'Before extracting, review the existing identity entries and the retrieved',
  'similar memories (top {{ topK }}). Extract items that are NEW or MATERIALLY',
  'UPDATED compared to the references. Avoid duplicates or near-duplicates.',
  '\n',
  '## Name Handling and Neutrality',
  '\n',
  '- Always refer to the user with the exact placeholder token "User". Do not',
  "  infer, invent, or translate the user's real name.",
  '- Do not assign gendered terms or honorifics (e.g., "先生 / 女士", "Mr./Ms.").',
  '  Keep all references neutral during extraction.',
  '- If the conversation states a persistent preferred form of address, record that',
  '  as a preference (preference layer) instead of embedding it into identity',
  '  descriptions.',
  '\n',
  '## Existing Identity Entries',
  '\n',
  "Below is the full list of the user's current identity entries. Use",

  'confident enough, with scoreConfidence lowered accordingly.',
  '\n',
  '## Output guidelines',
  '\n',
  '- Always include `add`, `update`, and `remove` keys; use an empty array when',
  '  there are no actions of that type.',
  '- Each `add` item must include a rich `description`, `type`, and optional fields',
  '  like `relationship`, `role`, `episodicDate`, `extractedLabels`,',
  '  `scoreConfidence`, and `sourceEvidence`.',
  '- Each `update` item must include `id`, `mergeStrategy`, and a `set` object with',
  '  changed fields.',
  '- Each `remove` item must include `id` and `reason`.',
  '\n',
  'When available, populate `episodicDate` for time-bound milestones (e.g.,',
  'certification dates, competition results, new jobs, adopting a pet, discovering',
  'new skills or passions).',
  '\n',
  '## Memory Formatting Guidelines',
  '\n',
  '> CRITICAL REQUIREMENT: ALL MEMORY ITEMS MUST BE SELF-CONTAINED',
  '- Do not append date or time information to the `title`; keep timing in temporal fields or narrative instead.',
  '\n',
  'Every memory item you create must be standalone and understandable without',
  'extra context:',
  '\n',
  '✓ **Required Elements:**',
  '\n',
  '- Use full names and specific subjects—NEVER use pronouns (he/she/they/it/this/',
  '  that)',
  '- Include specific names, places, dates, and complete context',
  '- Preserve the original language from user input—do not translate',
  '- Capture relevant details, emotions, and outcomes',
  '- Ensure each item is comprehensible independently',
  '\n',
  '✓ **Good Examples:**',
  '\n',
  '- "{{ username }} attended an LGBTQ support group on 2024-03-15 where',
  '  {{ username }} heard inspiring transgender stories from community members and',
  '  felt happy, thankful, and accepted, gaining courage to embrace',
  '  {{ username }}\'s true self."',
  '- "{{ username }} discussed future career plans with Melanie during their',
  '  counseling session, expressed keen interest in mental health work that',
  '  supports people with similar experiences, and received encouragement from',
  '  Melanie, who said {{ username }} would excel as a counselor due to',
  '  {{ username }}\'s natural empathy and deep understanding."',
  '\n',
  '✗ **Bad Examples:**',
  '\n',
  '- "She went to a support group" → Missing: who, when, what happened, emotional',
  '  outcome',
  '- "They felt happy" → Missing: who, context, cause of emotion',
  '- "The discussion was helpful" → Missing: participants, topic, specific value',
  '  gained',
  '- "This made them realize something important" → Vague pronouns and undefined',
  '  referents',
  '\n',
  '## Layer-Specific Extraction Guidance',
  '\n',
  'Focus on stable personal attributes, roles, demographics, and self-concept.',
  'Document relationships and how they influence the user. Preserve rich',
  'narratives about background, experience, and roles. Distinguish static identity',
  'facts from dynamic activities and events. Aim for a clear biography or resume of',
  'the user.',
  '\n',
  'Further guidance:',
  '\n',
  "- Treat identity as the user's side profile. Prefer a single canonical entry per",
  '  identity aspect; use updates to refine precision over time.',
  '- If prior records conflict with new ground truth, prefer `updateIdentityEntry`',
  '  with an appropriate `scoreConfidence`. If evidence is weak, keep confidence',
  '  lower and avoid removals.',
  '- Never copy text verbatim from retrieved entries; use them for deduplication',
  '  and matching.',
  '\n',
  'Examples of identity information:',
  '\n',
  '- "{{ username }} works as a Software Engineer at TechFlow Solutions"',
  '- "{{ username }} is learning Japanese and practices daily for 30 minutes"',
  '- "{{ username }} has a close relationship with mentor Sarah Chen, who provides',
  '  career guidance"',
  '\n',
  'Not identity (these are activities or events):',
  '\n',
  '- "{{ username }} went hiking last weekend"',
  '- "{{ username }} attended a workshop on 2024-03-10"',
  '\n',
  '## Memory Type Classifications',
  '\n',
  'Choose the appropriate memoryType:',
  '\n',
  '- **activity**: Detailed conversations, interactions, and events with full',
  '  contextual narrative',
  '- **event**: Specific time-bound occurrences (dates, milestones, appointments,',
  '  meetings)',
  '- **fact**: Factual information, data points, and verifiable knowledge',
  '- **preference**: User choices, likes, dislikes, and behavioral preferences',
  '- **context**: Background information, situational details, environmental',
  '  factors',
  '- **location**: Geographic information, places, and spatial context',
  '- **people**: Information about individuals and their relationships',
  '- **topic**: Subject matter, domains of interest, and knowledge areas',
  '- **technology**: Tools, platforms, software, and technical systems',
  '- **other**: Miscellaneous information not fitting other categories',
  '\n',
  '## Security Considerations',
  '\n',
  '**NEVER extract or store sensitive information:**',
  '\n',
  '- Passwords, PINs, or authentication credentials',
  '- API keys, tokens, or secret keys',
  '- Financial data (credit cards, bank accounts, SSN)',
  '- Medical records or protected health information',
  '- Private encryption keys or certificates',
  '\n',
  '---',
  '\n',
  '## Final Instructions',
  '\n',
  '1. Analyze the conversation for identity layer information',
  '2. Extract each distinct identity memory as a separate item',
  '3. Ensure all memories are self-contained (no pronouns, complete context)',
  '4. Return a JSON object conforming to the schema above with arrays (empty when none, e.g. `withIdentities: { "add": [], "update": [], "remove": [] }` if no any operations)',
  '5. No matter what the language of the retrieved language is, always use {{ language }} for output',
  '\n',
  'Respond with valid JSON without commentary.',
