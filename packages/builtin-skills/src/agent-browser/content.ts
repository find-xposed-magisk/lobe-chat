# agent-browser

\`agent-browser\` is a fast browser automation CLI for AI agents — drives Chrome/Chromium via CDP and serves accessibility-tree snapshots with compact \`@eN\` element refs (so you act on the page in a few hundred tokens, not raw HTML).

LobeHub desktop bundles \`agent-browser\` natively — no install needed. \`agent-browser\` lives on the user's device: when \`lobe-local-system\` runCommand is available, run all \`agent-browser\` commands through it — never through the skills exec APIs (their cloud sandbox has no browser and no \`agent-browser\` binary). Outside LobeHub, install with \`npm i -g agent-browser\` (or \`brew install agent-browser\` / \`cargo install agent-browser\`), then run \`agent-browser install\` once to fetch the bundled Chrome.

## The core loop

\`\`\`bash
agent-browser open <url>     # 1. navigate
agent-browser snapshot -i    # 2. see interactive elements (@e1, @e2, …)
agent-browser click @e3      # 3. act on a ref
agent-browser snapshot -i    # 4. re-snapshot after any page change
\`\`\`

Refs become **stale on every page change** (click that navigates, form submit, dynamic re-render, dialog open). Always re-snapshot before the next ref interaction.

If a page opens to an empty body or a verification/challenge screen, treat it as a block, not a slow load — go straight to the real-Chrome step below.

If a page requires signing in (a login form, an account/password wall, or an OTP/verification step you have no credentials for), don't guess credentials or engineer a way around the gate. Open it in a visible browser — the real-Chrome CDP window below is one — ask the user to sign in themselves in that window, and continue once they confirm.

When the task is done — every time, as the final step and without waiting to be asked — run \`agent-browser close\` and quit any Chrome you launched for CDP. A browser you opened for the task otherwise keeps running on the user's machine. See the teardown rule below for how to quit the CDP Chrome without touching the user's own browser.

## Blocked or dynamic pages — go straight to real Chrome

An empty body, a verification/challenge screen, or a page that is mostly obfuscated JS is **blocked, not still loading** — and no amount of waiting, reloading, or re-screenshotting changes a fingerprint. So this is one decision, not a ladder: did you get real text back? If not, drive the user's own Chrome over CDP and commit to it.

1. **One headless check** — \`agent-browser open <url>\`, one \`agent-browser wait --load networkidle\`, then \`agent-browser eval "document.body.innerText.length"\`. Real text → done.
2. **Zero / near-zero → real Chrome over CDP now.** Its human fingerprint clears the JS challenge in one pass:
   \`\`\`bash
   # macOS (Linux: use \`google-chrome\`) — launch the user's real Chrome with a debug port, in the background
   "/Applications/Google Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google Chrome" \\
     --remote-debugging-port=9222 --user-data-dir="$HOME/.agent-browser-cdp" &
   agent-browser --cdp 9222 open <url>                              # drive THAT browser
   agent-browser --cdp 9222 wait --load networkidle                 # let the challenge run + reload settle
   agent-browser --cdp 9222 eval "document.body.innerText.length"   # re-verify you got content
   \`\`\`

**Commit to real Chrome; don't thrash.** Once step 1 comes back empty, do not sleep, reload, re-screenshot, switch to \`--headed\` (same automation browser — not an escalation), or reopen the session. And do NOT hand-roll the bypass yourself — no reversing the challenge JS, no computing clearance cookies with curl/python/node. Those are slow, per-site, and break on the next algorithm change; real Chrome is the general answer, so go there and see it through.

**To stop the CDP Chrome, target the automation instance only — never kill by name.** Prefer \`agent-browser --cdp 9222 close\`. If a process lingers and you must force-kill it, match only its dedicated user-data-dir marker: \`pkill -f "user-data-dir=$HOME/.agent-browser-cdp"\`. Do NOT match on \`--remote-debugging-port=9222\` alone — 9222 is the standard CDP port and may belong to a Chrome the user themselves opened for debugging. NEVER \`pkill -f "Google Chrome"\` or \`killall "Google Chrome"\` — that pattern also matches the user's own everyday Chrome and will close all their windows and tabs. The same rule applies when a CDP connect fails and you need to relaunch: kill only the marked instance, never the user's Chrome.

A JS-challenge cookie (\`cf_clearance\`, \`*_jsl_clearance*\`, \`acw_tc\`, …) next to an empty/challenge body confirms the block. The same cookie next to real content means the challenge already passed — keep the session and read the page. Dump large page output to a file first, then \`grep\`/\`head\` it.

## Discovering everything else

Run \`agent-browser --help\` for the full command list, then \`agent-browser <subcommand> --help\` for any subcommand whose flags you're unsure about. The CLI also ships specialized skills (\`agent-browser skills list\`, \`agent-browser skills get <name>\`) covering Electron apps, Slack, dogfooding, Vercel Sandbox, and AWS Bedrock AgentCore — load one only when the task falls outside ordinary web pages. Those docs are command references; the real-Chrome rule above still governs how you respond to blocked pages.
