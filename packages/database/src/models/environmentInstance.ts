 * state a cache rather than the only record: when it no longer matches the
 * environment's `configuration`, this instance is out of date and can be
 * rebuilt from the specification instead of being repaired by hand.
 *
 * Ownership is inherited, not stored — there is no owner column here, so every
 * statement reaches through the environment. That is load-bearing rather than
 * incidental: an instance's captured state includes a home directory, and a
 * home directory holds credentials.
 *
 * Which is why the two directions differ. READS follow the environment's
 * visibility, so a member can run in an environment a colleague published —
 * that is what publishing one means. WRITES stay with the creator: using a
 * shared environment must not let anyone reshape it, add copies to it, or
