 * cache that can be rebuilt from this row and thrown away.
 *
 * Writes are scoped to the MEMBER, including inside a workspace where `user_id`
 * merely records the creator. Reads follow `visibility`, which defaults to
 * private and starts there for every row that predates the column — so nothing
 * became visible to anyone by the act of adding it.
 *
 * Publishing one is a real decision, by one step of reasoning worth spelling
 * out: an instance has no owner column and inherits its scope from here, and an
 * instance's captured state carries whatever a session left in a home directory
 * — including the token a CLI logged in with. So a published environment is an
 * identity a colleague can borrow, and the borrower would see nothing unusual,
 * only a CLI that happens to be signed in. That is the same bargain a shared
 * device makes, which is why it is offered the same way: private by default,
 * published only through a dialog that names the consequence.
 *
 * `project_environments` remains the path for referencing a specification
 * WITHOUT handing over anything built from it. Taking it needs instances to
 * carry an owner of their own first.
