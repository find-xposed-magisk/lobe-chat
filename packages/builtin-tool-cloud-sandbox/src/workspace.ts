/**
 * Persistent sandbox workspace: the vocabulary LobeHub needs to ASK for one and
 * to tell the model it has one.
 *
 * The cloud sandbox is a per-topic, disposable runtime. A persistent workspace
 * is a directory on a volume mounted into it that outlives the session and is
 * shared across the user's topics. Two independent inputs decide whether a run
 * actually gets one:
 *
 * 1. **Entitlement** — LobeHub resolves the caller's plan into a signed
 *    `sandboxStorage` claim (`{ key, quotaBytes }` or none) on the trusted
 *    client token. LobeHub is the sole authority for the key; nothing derives
 *    it from a request body.
 * 2. **Mode** — the run asks for `'persistent'` or `'ephemeral'`. Default is
 *    ephemeral: persistence is an explicit choice per topic, not every task
 *    wants to leave files behind.
 *
 * Only the AND of the two routes to the persistent runtime. Everything after
 * that point — which volume, which mount root, how paths resolve against the
 * directory — belongs to the execution plane, NOT here. This module therefore
 * contains no path handling at all: deriving a directory on this side would
 * reintroduce exactly the combination the routing is built to make impossible,
 * an ephemeral sandbox addressed with persistent-looking absolute paths.
 */

/**
 * Whether a run wants its working directory to survive the session.
 *
 * Positive form on purpose, and ephemeral by default: the safe state is the one
 * you get by saying nothing. A negative flag (`disablePersistent…`) inverts
 * that — a caller that forgets it opts into persistence by accident.
