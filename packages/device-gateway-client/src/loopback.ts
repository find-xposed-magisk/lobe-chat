/**
 * Which loopback address actually answers on a port.
 *
 * The gateway pins tunnel targets to `127.0.0.1`, but plenty of dev servers
 * bind `localhost`, which newer Node resolves to `::1` only — `vite` with no
 * `--host` does exactly that on macOS. Dialing `127.0.0.1` then gets
 * ECONNREFUSED for a server that is plainly running. So before a tunnel dials
 * out, probe the port and fall back to `::1` when IPv4 refuses. Both are
 * loopback, so the security boundary is unchanged.
 *
 * Probing is a TCP connect-and-close, done before the real request so the
 * request itself (and any streamed body) is only ever sent once. Results are
 * cached briefly per port; a stale answer costs one failed request, after
 * which the cache entry is dropped.

 * `NO_PROXY` matches the host — and the common `NO_PROXY=...,::1` does not
 * match the bracketed `[::1]` a URL carries, so the `::1` fallback below
 * would land on the proxy and come back as its 502. Adding every loopback
 * spelling is correct for any process: nothing should proxy loopback.
 *
 * Node reads these variables per request, so this takes effect immediately.
 * Bun snapshots them at startup, so a source run under `bun` with a proxy set
