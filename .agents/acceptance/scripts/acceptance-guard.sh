# LobeHub adapter over the acceptance skill's resource guard.
#
# A run boots a browser, a dev server and type-check workers. Left alone they grow
# until the host swaps itself to a crawl and the client driving the run freezes —
# measured in this repository at 30.9 GB / 31.7 GB of swap with 867 MB free. The
# skill's guard owns the generic half of the fix: sample the host, tier it, and stop
# only what this run can prove it started. This wrapper owns the project half — the
# groups worth watching here, this repository's thresholds, and the run's state dir.
#
# Usage:
#   acceptance-guard.sh start                    start this run's sampler
#   acceptance-guard.sh claim <pid>...           register a process this run started
#   acceptance-guard.sh claim-browser [session]  claim the browser behind an agent-browser session
#   acceptance-guard.sh check [--json]           one sample now; exit 0 green, 10 yellow, 20 red
#   acceptance-guard.sh status [--json]          this run's recorded guard state
#   acceptance-guard.sh stop                     stop the sampler (teardown; always)
#
# Environment:
#   ACCEPTANCE_RUN_TAG     required. Names this run. Ownership of a process is proven
#                          by this tag or by an explicit claim, so it has to be
#                          specific enough not to appear in unrelated command lines.
#   ACCEPTANCE_GUARD_DIR   state directory (default: ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/lobe-acceptance/guard/<tag>)
#   ACCEPTANCE_GUARD_YELLOW, ACCEPTANCE_GUARD_RED   override the thresholds
#   ACCEPTANCE_GUARD_SCRIPT   the skill's guard to wrap (test seam)
#
# The thresholds are host-level on purpose. The group patterns below also match other
# worktrees' servers and other runs' browsers — five such processes held ~20 GB here
# — so a group or total RSS cap would turn a merely busy machine red and stop a
# healthy run. Swap exhaustion is what actually freezes the host, so that is what
# this adapter tiers on; the groups exist so `stop-owned` has something it may stop.
