# 🚀 LobeHub Release (20260416)

**Release Date:** April 20, 2026\
**Migration Scope:** Agent benchmark data model bootstrap (5 new tables, 2 new indexes)

> This release introduces a schema foundation for benchmark execution and reporting, so agent evaluation data is stored as a complete lifecycle instead of fragmented records.

---

## 🗄️ Migration Overview

Added tables:

- `agent_eval_benchmarks`
- `agent_eval_datasets`
- `agent_eval_runs`
- `agent_eval_run_topics`
- `agent_eval_records`

Added indexes:

- `idx_agent_eval_runs_status_created_at`
- `idx_agent_eval_run_topics_run_id_topic_id`

These additions close a previous gap where benchmark data existed in partial forms but lacked a stable relational backbone for auditing and historical analysis.

---

## ⚙️ Operator Notes

- Migration runs automatically on application startup.
- No manual SQL is required in standard deployment paths.
- Schedule rollout in a low-traffic window and take a backup snapshot before deployment.
- If migration fails, do not retry repeatedly; inspect migration logs and lock state first.

---

## 🔒 Reliability & Risk

- Existing chat/session paths are unaffected unless benchmark features are enabled.
- Migration is additive (new tables/indexes only), minimizing downgrade risk to existing entities.
- Rollback should follow your standard DB restore or migration rollback policy if your environment requires strict reversibility.
