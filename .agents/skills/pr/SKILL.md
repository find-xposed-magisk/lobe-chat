# Create Pull Request

## Branch Strategy

- **Target branch**: `canary` (development branch, cloud production)
- `main` is the release branch — never PR directly to main

## Steps

### 1. Gather context (run in parallel)

- `git branch --show-current` — current branch name
- `git status --short` — uncommitted changes
- `git rev-parse --abbrev-ref @{u} 2>/dev/null` — remote tracking status
- `git log --oneline origin/canary..HEAD` — unpushed commits
- `gh pr list --head "$(git branch --show-current)" --json number,title,state,url` — existing PR
- `git diff --stat --stat-count=20 origin/canary..HEAD` — change summary
- Reuse an existing acceptance link from the task when it covers the delivered behavior. If a lookup is needed, first follow [Publish auth preflight](../../acceptance/PROCESS.md#publish-auth-preflight), then run `publish_lh acceptance run list --json` and match on `branch`. Do not blindly unset API keys: the production credential may exist only in the environment. A lookup never requires creating a new round.

### 2. Handle uncommitted changes on default branch

If current branch is `canary` (or `main`) AND there are uncommitted changes:

1. Analyze the diff (`git diff`) to understand the changes
2. Infer a branch name from the changes, format: `<type>/<short-description>` (e.g. `fix/i18n-cjk-spacing`)
3. Create and switch to the new branch: `git checkout -b <branch-name>`
4. Stage relevant files: `git add <files>` (prefer explicit file paths over `git add .`)
5. Commit with a proper gitmoji message
6. Continue to step 3

If current branch is `canary`/`main` but there are NO uncommitted changes and no unpushed commits, abort — nothing to create a PR for.

### 3. Push if needed

- No upstream: `git push -u origin $(git branch --show-current)`
- Has upstream: `git push origin $(git branch --show-current)`

### 4. Search related GitHub issues

- `gh issue list --search "<keywords>" --state all --limit 10`
- Only link issues with matching scope (avoid large umbrella issues)
- Skip if no matching issue found

### 5. Acceptance gate

A feature or fix needs a published acceptance round before the PR is opened (AGENTS.md → Acceptance). If step 1 found none for this branch, run the `acceptance` skill first and come back with its `https://app.lobehub.com/acceptance/<id>` link. When the delivery was already verified on the real product earlier in the session, that skill's ingest path publishes the existing observations and artifacts directly — no re-run, no re-plan. Pure refactors or tooling changes with no user-visible outcome may skip it — state that in the PR body instead of leaving the line out.

### 6. Create PR with `gh pr create --base canary`

- Title: `<gitmoji> <type>(<scope>): <description>`
- Body: based on PR template (`.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`)
- Obey the `AGENT-INSTRUCTIONS` HTML comments in that template. Keep them commented out, and do not copy them into the visible description.
- Link related GitHub issues using magic keywords (`Fixes #123`, `Closes #123`)
- Link Linear issues if applicable (`Fixes LOBE-xxx`)
- Put the acceptance link (or the explicit skip reason) under **Test** in the Summary section.
- Follow the source-label, privacy, and AI assistance rules in **PR Template** below when creating or updating a PR. Do not request prompt disclosure or block the normal PR workflow waiting for consent to publish a conversation.
- Write the body to a temporary file and use `--body-file` to preserve formatting.

### 7. Open in browser

`gh pr view --web`

## PR Template

Use [`.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`](../../../.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md) as the source of truth for body structure, contribution classification, disclosure eligibility, and required fields. Follow its `AGENT-INSTRUCTIONS` when filling these sections:

- **Summary**: fill for every PR, including the required Contribution source label. AI-assisted work remains labeled `AI-assisted` even when organization membership exempts the author from disclosing details; human review does not make it human-only. Use `Unknown` when the source cannot be established.
- **AI assistance**: apply the template's organization-member exemption to details only, never to the source label. When required, fill its six fields using the final diff and verification evidence, not private conversation summaries. Use one section per PR, combining tools/models across sessions; report unknown metadata and unperformed review/checks honestly.

Prompts and transcripts are private by default and are not required fields. Only if the author explicitly requests sharing them, review the exact proposed text for sensitive information and obtain confirmation before publishing that text. Authorization to create or update a PR is not consent to publish a conversation. Check attached logs and screenshots for sensitive information too.

### No production data identifiers

PR titles, bodies, comments and review replies are public. Never put an identifier or detail taken from production data in them, even when that is where the bug was found:

- Record ids: topic (`tpc_…`), message (`msg_…`), operation (`op_…`), agent (`agt_…`), document (`docs_…`), user, device and bot ids. This includes agent vent ids and ids of internal reproduction reports.
- User details: device or host names, local paths, file names, quoted user text, and app links to a user's agent or topic.

Describe the evidence instead: "observed in a production topic", "a user with two desktops (device A and device B)". Obvious placeholders (`tpc_xxx`, `C:\Users\user`) are fine in examples. Commit hashes, deployment ids and code identifiers are not production data. The same rule applies to commit messages and code comments.

## Notes

- **Language**: All PR content must be in English
- If a PR already exists for the branch, inform the user instead of creating a duplicate

# Stacked PRs (cross-layer feature)

The steps above create **one** PR for the current branch. When a single branch lands across layers — `packages/database` schema/model → a shared `packages/*` lib → `src/server` TRPC → `apps/desktop` + `apps/cli` callers → `src/features` UI — shipping it as one PR can't merge safely: the clients call an endpoint that doesn't exist on the trunk until the same PR merges, so any partial/rollback or independent review breaks. Split it into **ordered PRs**, lower layer first.

## The ordering rule

A PR may only merge **after** every layer it calls is already on the trunk.

- The **server contract** (new TRPC procedure, changed return shape, new table/model) merges first.
- The **callers** (desktop, CLI, UI) merge after — they invoke that contract.
- Tie-break with one question: _"if this merged alone to `canary` right now, would it build and behave?"_ If no, it belongs in a later PR.

## Which file goes in which PR

The non-obvious calls:

- **Frontend that adapts to a contract change goes WITH the server PR.** If you widen a TRPC return shape (e.g. `listDevices` now returns `platform: string | null`), the component consuming it must change in the _same_ PR — otherwise the server PR breaks the build on its own. Contract + its in-repo consumers ship together.
- **A new shared package goes with its consumer**, not the server, unless the server imports it too. A `@lobechat/*` package imported only by desktop/CLI ships in the client PR. Don't carry an unused package in the lower PR.
- **Workspace dep declarations** (`package.json` `workspace:*`, `pnpm-workspace.yaml`) travel with the code that imports the package.

## The git recipe — split an existing full branch

Starting point: one branch (`feat/x`) with a single commit `<FULL>` containing everything, already pushed (so it's also safe on the remote).

```bash
# 1. Safety nets — make the full work unloseable before rewriting anything
git branch backup/x-full <FULL>          # local ref to the full commit
git branch feat/x-clients <FULL>         # the higher-layer branch starts here

# 2. Rewrite the lower-layer branch to lower-layer files only
git checkout feat/x                      # this becomes the SERVER PR
git reset --hard origin/canary
git checkout <FULL> -- <server/db files…>   # stages just those paths
git commit -m "✨ feat(...): <server half>"
git push --force-with-lease origin feat/x   # never --force; never push to canary

# 3. Build the higher-layer branch STACKED on the lower branch
git checkout feat/x-clients
git reset --hard feat/x                  # base = the just-rewritten server HEAD
git checkout backup/x-full -- <client/ui files…>   # only the remaining paths
git commit -m "✨ feat(...): <client half>"
git push -u origin feat/x-clients
```

Then open the higher PR **based on the lower branch**, not the trunk:

```bash
gh pr create --base feat/x --head feat/x-clients --title "…" --body "…"
```

`--base feat/x` keeps the diff client-only (no server files leak in) and makes it physically impossible to merge the clients before the server. **After the server PR merges to `canary`, retarget the client PR's base to `canary`** (GitHub usually auto-retargets when the base branch merges; note it in the PR body so a human confirms).

## Verify the dependency actually holds

The whole point is the higher layer needs the lower one. Prove it: on the stacked higher branch, type-check the caller and confirm the symbol the lower layer introduced resolves.

```bash
cd apps/cli && bun run type-check 2>&1 | grep -iE "connect\.ts|device\.register"
# empty (re: your change) = the stacked base supplies device.register ✓
```

Filter to your touched files — this repo's standalone type-check emits pre-existing env noise (`__ELECTRON__`, `@/types/llm`, unbuilt `@lobechat/types`) that isn't yours.

## PR + Linear bookkeeping

- **Each PR closes only its own layer's issues.** Server PR: `Closes LOBE-<server>`. Client PR: `Closes LOBE-<pkg> / <desktop> / <cli>`. Don't let one PR's body claim another layer's issue.
- Both PRs are `Part of LOBE-<parent>`.
- On PR creation, move each closed sub-issue to **In Review** (not Done) and add a completion comment — see the `linear` skill.

## Gotchas

- **Never push to `canary`.** A split branch cut with `git checkout -b feat/x origin/canary` _tracks_ `origin/canary`, so a bare `git push` targets canary. Always `git push origin feat/x` with the explicit branch name.
- **`--force-with-lease`, not `--force`** when rewriting the lower branch — it aborts if the remote moved under you.
- **Back up before `reset --hard`.** Step 1's `backup/x-full` + the pushed remote branch mean the full commit is referenced by ≥3 refs before you rewrite anything. Verify with `git branch --contains <FULL>`.
- **Lockfiles:** this monorepo commits no root `pnpm-lock.yaml`, so a new `workspace:*` dep needs no lockfile churn. In a repo that _does_ commit one, regenerate it on each branch after the split.
- **Don't over-split.** Two PRs (contract / callers) is usually enough. A UI page that only reads an existing endpoint can be its own later PR, but don't fragment a single layer across PRs for its own sake.
