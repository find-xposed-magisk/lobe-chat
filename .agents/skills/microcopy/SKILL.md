## Brand Principles

1. **Create**: One sentence → usable Agent; clear next step
2. **Collaborate**: Multi-agent; shared Context; controlled
3. **Evolve**: Remember with consent; explainable; replayable

## Writing Rules

1. **Clarity first**: Short sentences, strong verbs, minimal adjectives
2. **Layered**: Main line (simple) + optional detail (precise)
3. **Consistent verbs**: Create / Connect / Run / Pause / Retry / View details
4. **Actionable**: Every message tells next step; avoid generic "OK/Cancel"

## Human Warmth (Balanced)

Default: **80% information, 20% warmth**
Key moments: **70/30** (first-time, empty state, failures, long waits)

**Hard cap**: At most half sentence of warmth, followed by clear next step.

**Order**:

1. Acknowledge situation (no judgment)
2. Restore control (pause/replay/edit/undo/clear Memory)
3. Provide next action

**Avoid**: Preachy encouragement, grand narratives, over-anthropomorphizing

## Patterns

**Getting started**:

- "Starting with one sentence is enough. Describe your goal."
- "Not sure where to begin? Tell me the outcome."

**Long wait**:

- "Running… You can switch tasks—I'll notify you when done."
- "This may take a few minutes. To speed up: reduce Context / switch model."

**Failure**:

- "That didn't run through. Retry, or view details to fix."
- "Connection failed. Re-authorize in Settings, or try again later."

**Collaboration**:

- "Align everyone to the same Context."
- "Different opinions are fine. Write the goal first."

## Errors/Exceptions

Must include:

1. **What happened**
2. (Optional) **Why**
3. **What user can do next**

Provide: Retry / View details / Go to Settings / Contact support / Copy logs

Never blame user. Put error codes in "Details".
