description: LobeHub's design system, built on lobe-ui (@lobehub/ui). Tokens are themeable — primary and neutral colors are user-configurable and resolve to CSS variables (cssVar key `lobe-vars`). This is the Light theme; the Dark theme uses the same token names with different values and is documented in DESIGN.dark.md.

# LobeHub

## Overview

LobeHub is an AI-native product suite (chat, agents, tools). Its design system is built on `lobe-ui` ([@lobehub/ui](https://github.com/lobehub/lobe-ui)) — LobeHub's own component and theming layer — and is themed at runtime through `ThemeProvider` with the cssVar key `lobe-vars`.

The aesthetic is calm and content-first: generous whitespace, restrained color, and a near-neutral canvas so the conversation and the user's content stay in focus. Color carries state and hierarchy, not decoration. Every surface is designed for both light and dark appearance and for desktop and mobile.

The YAML above lists the default Light theme. The Dark theme redefines the same token names with different values and lives in [DESIGN.dark.md](./DESIGN.dark.md) — every other section here (typography, layout, motion, shapes, components, voice, values) is theme-independent and applies to both. Build against token names, not values.

## Colors

LobeHub uses lobe-ui's semantic token model. A token's name encodes its role, so the same name resolves to the right value in light, dark, and under any user theme. Always consume tokens by name — `cssVar.colorText`, `cssVar.colorBgContainer`, and so on.

Text uses solid neutrals from the `gray` scale that hold contrast on any surface — rank information with them rather than reaching for color:

- `colorText` — primary text and icons
- `colorTextSecondary` — secondary text, form labels
- `colorTextTertiary` — placeholders, captions, metadata
- `colorTextQuaternary` — disabled

Surfaces are a separate scale from text; do not swap one for the other. `colorBgLayout` is the page canvas, `colorBgContainer` is the primary card/panel surface, `colorBgContainerSecondary` gives subtle separation, `colorBgElevated` backs popovers, menus, and modals, and `colorBgSpotlight` backs tooltips.

Borders and fills are translucent (`rgba`/alpha), so they layer over any background. Use `colorBorderSecondary` for the everyday divider and `colorBorder` for a stronger edge; use the `colorFill*` ramp for hover/active washes (`colorFillTertiary` hover, `colorFillQuaternary` active).

Functional color is reserved for meaning: `colorPrimary` for the single most important action, focus, and links — note it is monochrome by default (near-black in light, near-white in dark) and only takes on a hue when the user picks a primary color, which keeps the default UI calm; `colorSuccess`, `colorWarning`, `colorError`, `colorInfo` for state. Each functional and accent color also exposes a derived ramp — `color{Name}`, `color{Name}Hover`, `color{Name}Active`, `color{Name}Bg`, `color{Name}Border`, `color{Name}Text`, and `color{Name}Fill*` — so you can build tinted backgrounds, borders, and text without picking raw values.

Applying tokens in components. The text ramp and the functional tints are full token sets, but component prop shorthands expose only part of them — so apply the token directly when no shorthand covers it. In `@lobehub/ui`, the `Text` `type` prop accepts `secondary | success | warning | danger | info` only (there is no `tertiary` / `quaternary`), and `Tag` `color` has no `primary`. For `colorTextTertiary` / `colorTextQuaternary` text, and for any `colorPrimary` or functional tint a shorthand lacks, set the token via `color={cssVar.colorTextTertiary}` (or a styled class) instead of `type="tertiary"` / `color="primary"` — the invalid prop values fail silently (rendered as a literal color or ignored), not with an error.

## Typography

`Geist` sets UI and prose; `Geist Mono` sets code, data, and tabular figures. Use the scale tokens rather than setting size, weight, or line height by hand:

- Body & labels — `fontSize` (14px) covers most UI and body text; `fontSizeSM` (12px) for captions and dense metadata; `fontSizeLG` (16px) for emphasis and large controls. Line height is generous (\~1.57) for readability. The body/label scale is 12 / 14 / 16 — there is no 13px token. Some legacy UI hard-codes `fontSize={13}` for secondary text; treat that as drift and round to 12 or 14, and rank text with the `colorText*` opacity ramp rather than reaching for an in-between size. Don't introduce new off-scale sizes.
- Headings — `fontSizeHeading1`–`fontSizeHeading5` (38 → 16px) title pages and sections; pair with `fontWeightStrong` (600).
- Code & numbers — the `fontFamilyCode` stack; prefer tabular figures when numbers must align.

## Layout

Spacing follows a 4px scale via lobe-ui padding/margin tokens: `XXS` 4, `XS` 8, `SM` 12, base 16, `MD` 20, `LG` 24, `XL` 32. Keep a clear rhythm — tight space inside a group (8px), more between groups (16px), most between sections (24–32px). Cards use 16–24px padding.

The 4px scale governs gaps, padding, and margins — and only those. Two things are deliberately not on it: radius is a separate scale (see [Shapes](#shapes); it includes a 6px step, `borderRadiusSM`), so never reuse a radius value as spacing; and icon pixel sizes (12 / 14 / 16 / 18 / 20) and 1px hairline borders are dimensions, not spacing. Off-scale spacing values (6, 10, 13…) are drift — round to the nearest scale step. Reserve a one-off off-scale value for genuine optical tuning, never as a default.

Layouts must work across appearances and form factors: every surface ships light and dark and desktop and mobile variants. Mobile is not an afterthought — `src/routes/(mobile)` and `.mobile`/`.desktop` component variants exist for exactly this. Center primary content and let side padding grow at wider breakpoints.

## Elevation & Depth

Hierarchy comes from tonal surfaces and borders first, so shadows stay subtle. Lift only what genuinely floats:

- Raised cards / panels: `boxShadowTertiary`, barely-there — most cards need none, just a `colorBorderSecondary` edge.
- Popovers and menus: `boxShadowSecondary`.
- Modals and dialogs: `boxShadow`, the strongest tier.

The shadow tokens are shared across light and dark. Only the surface and border colors change between themes. Tooltips take the lightest treatment on `colorBgSpotlight`. Pair each elevation with the matching radius below, and prefer a border over a shadow when both would read.

## Motion

Motion clarifies change; it is never decoration. Honor `prefers-reduced-motion` by dropping nonessential animation.

When motion helps — revealing, moving, or connecting elements — keep it short and physical: roughly 100–200ms for state changes and popovers, up to \~300ms for overlays and modals. Avoid long, looping, or attention-grabbing animation. For AI/loading moments, prefer the system's purpose-built loaders (skeletons, `NeuralNetworkLoading`) over ad-hoc spinners.

## Shapes

Radii stay soft but tight, and one family per view:

- `borderRadiusXS` 4px — tags, chips
- `borderRadiusSM` 6px — inputs, small controls
- `borderRadius` 8px — the default, for buttons and cards
- `borderRadiusLG` 12px — menus, modals, large surfaces

Reserve fully round (`9999px`) for pills, avatars, and circular icon buttons. Don't mix rounded and sharp corners in one view.

## Components

Prefer the system's components over bespoke markup, in this order:

1. `@lobehub/ui/base-ui` — headless primitives, first choice for new code (`Select`, `Modal` / `createModal` / `confirmModal`, `DropdownMenu`, `ContextMenu`, `Popover`, `ScrollArea`, `Switch`, `Toast`, `FloatingSheet`).
2. `@lobehub/ui` root — richer composed components when base-ui has no counterpart.

When base-ui has the component, use it — don't reach for the root version, and only drop to an underlying primitive when lobe-ui has no counterpart at all.

Default control height is 36px (`controlHeight`); use `controlHeightSM` 28px and `controlHeightLG` 40px for the other sizes. Buttons follow lobe-ui's hierarchy — one primary (`colorPrimary` fill) per view for the most important action, default (surface fill + `colorBorder`) for ordinary actions, text/link for low-emphasis, and danger (`colorError`) for destructive actions. Hover and active states step through the `colorFill*` / `color{Name}Hover` ramps; disabled uses `colorTextQuaternary` text with a not-allowed cursor. Every interactive element shows a visible focus ring at `:focus-visible`.

Style components with lobe-ui's styling layer: prefer `createStaticStyles` with `cssVar.*` (zero-runtime) and fall back to `createStyles` + `token` only when styles need runtime computation.

## Status Icons

Topic and task surfaces speak **one status-icon language**. There is a single source of truth — `STATUS_META` in `src/components/StatusIcon` — and every surface (sidebar group headers, list rows, kanban, tags, detail) maps its own status enum onto a canonical `StatusKind` and reads icon + color from there. Never redefine a local status→icon map.

The vocabulary is built on the lucide `Circle-*` family so all states read as one set:

| Kind             | Icon           | Color token            | Meaning                                                                           |
| ---------------- | -------------- | ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `running`        | `CircleDot`    | `colorWarning`         | actively executing (static glyph)                                                 |
| `scheduled`      | `Clock`        | `colorWarning`         | queued for a future run                                                           |
| `needsAttention` | `Hand`         | `colorInfo`            | a human is needed (topic `pending`/`waitingForHuman`, task `paused`/`needsInput`) |
| `paused`         | `PauseCircle`  | `colorTextDescription` | genuinely suspended                                                               |
| `completed`      | `CircleCheck`  | `colorSuccess`         | finished successfully                                                             |
| `failed`         | `CircleX`      | `colorError`           | errored                                                                           |
| `backlog`        | `CircleDashed` | `colorTextQuaternary`  | not started / idle                                                                |
| `active`         | `CircleDot`    | `colorTextTertiary`    | open topic, not running                                                           |
| `canceled`       | `CircleSlash`  | `colorTextSecondary`   | canceled                                                                          |
| `archived`       | `Archive`      | `colorTextDescription` | archived                                                                          |
| `timeout`        | `CircleAlert`  | `colorWarning`         | timed out                                                                         |

Two rules the map encodes:

- **`running` is two-tier.** Group headers / summaries / count-badges show the **static** `CircleDot`. A row that is executing **right now** shows the **animated** `RingLoadingIcon` (the same CircleDot, spinning) — the one canonical live spinner; don't hand-roll another.
- **`Hand` means "needs you", never "paused".** `needsAttention` (blue hand) and `paused` (grey pause) are distinct concepts and must not be merged, even though task-land historically labeled the attention state `paused`.

> Migration note: a few topic surfaces still render legacy grey `CheckCircle2` (`completed`) / `TriangleAlert` (`failed`) locally instead of the canonical green-check / red-cross. Converging those two is a deferred follow-up — new code should use `STATUS_META`.

## Voice & Content

Copy is part of the design — precise, calm, and free of filler. The voice is youthful, friendly, and modern on the surface; professional, reliable, and control-first underneath (reference points: Notion, Figma, Apple, Discord, OpenAI).

- Never alternate synonyms (no "bot / assistant / AI agent" drift for Agent). Canonical terms: Workspace, Agent, Agent Profile, Group, Context, Memory, Integration, Skill, Topic, Page, Community, Resource, Library, MCP, Provider, Evaluation, Benchmark, Dataset, Test Case.
- Prefer plain words over jargon; when a technical term is unavoidable, gloss it in plain English.
- Clarity first — short sentences, strong verbs, few adjectives. No hype ("revolutionary", "epic", "100%").
- Layered, not split — one main line that is simple and actionable, plus an optional second line (subtitle, helper text, tooltip) for precision or boundaries. Don't ship "simple vs pro" variants.
- Consistent verbs — reuse the same verb for the same action everywhere: Create / Connect / Run / Pause / Retry / View details / Clear Memory.
- Every message tells the user what to do next. Name actions with a verb and a noun (`Create Agent`, `Delete Session`), never a bare `Confirm`, `OK`, or `Submit`.
- Confirm outcomes by naming the specific thing that changed; skip "successfully" and superlatives.
- In-progress states use a present participle with an ellipsis (`Generating…`, `Saving…`).

### Human warmth

Reduce anxiety and restore control without being sentimental. Default to 80% information, 20% warmth; at key moments (first run, empty state, long waits, failures, data-loss risk, collaboration conflicts) up to 70/30. Hard cap: at most half a sentence to one sentence of warmth, always followed by a clear next step. Order every sensitive message as:

1. Acknowledge the situation, without judgment.
2. Restore control — pause, replay, edit, undo, clear Memory, view Context.
3. Give the next action (button or path).

Avoid preachy encouragement ("don't worry"), grand narratives, and over-anthropomorphizing ("I understand you", "I'll always remember you"). The stance: Agents accelerate output, but the user owns the judgment and the final decision.

## Do's and Don'ts

- Read semantic tokens (`cssVar.colorText`, `cssVar.colorPrimary`, …); they adapt to the user's theme and to light/dark. Don't hard-code hex values from this file.
- Rank information with the text-opacity scale (`colorText` → `colorTextTertiary`). Don't signal state with color alone — pair it with an icon or label.
- Do keep solid `colorPrimary` for the single most important action and for state. Don't spread brand color as decoration.
- Do design all four data states — empty, loading, error, success. Don't ship only the happy path.
- Do build light + dark and desktop + mobile for every surface. Don't treat mobile or dark as an afterthought.
- Do keep `colorBg*` (surfaces) and the text/`colorFill` scales distinct. Don't swap a surface token for a text token.
- Do reach for `@lobehub/ui/base-ui` first, then `@lobehub/ui`. Don't rebuild a component the system already provides.
- Hold WCAG AA contrast (4.5:1 for body text) and show a visible `:focus-visible` ring.
- Don't mix rounded and sharp corners.
