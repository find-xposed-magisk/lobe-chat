In the continuous development of LobeChat, we deeply understand the importance of diversity in model service providers for meeting the needs of the community when providing AI conversation services. Therefore, we have expanded our support to multiple model service providers, rather than being limited to a single one, in order to offer users a more diverse and rich selection of conversations.

In this way, LobeChat can more flexibly adapt to the needs of different users, while also providing developers with a wider range of choices.

allowing users to interact with our conversational agent as if they were talking to a real person. Users can choose from a variety of voices to pair with the agent.

Moreover, TTS offers an excellent solution for those who prefer auditory learning or desire to receive information while busy.
In LobeChat, we have meticulously selected a range of high-quality voice options (OpenAI Audio, Microsoft Edge Speech) to meet the needs of users from different regions and cultural backgrounds.
Users can choose the voice that suits their personal preferences or specific scenarios, resulting in a personalized communication experience.

[![][image-feat-pwa]][docs-feat-pwa]

### `11` [Progressive Web App (PWA)][docs-feat-pwa]

We deeply understand the importance of providing a seamless experience for users in today's multi-device environment.
Therefore, we have adopted Progressive Web Application ([PWA](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/9658361)) technology,
a modern web technology that elevates web applications to an experience close to that of native apps.

Through PWA, LobeChat can offer a highly optimized user experience on both desktop and mobile devices while maintaining its lightweight and high-performance characteristics.
Visually and in terms of feel, we have also meticulously designed the interface to ensure it is indistinguishable from native apps,
providing smooth animations, responsive layouts, and adapting to different device screen resolutions.

> \[!NOTE]
>
> If you are unfamiliar with the installation process of PWA, you can add LobeChat as your desktop application (also applicable to mobile devices) by following these steps:
>
> - Launch the Chrome or Edge browser on your computer.
> - Visit the LobeChat webpage.
> - In the upper right corner of the address bar, click on the <kbd>Install</kbd> icon.
> - Follow the instructions on the screen to complete the PWA Installation.

[![][image-feat-theme]][docs-feat-theme]

### `13` [Custom Themes][docs-feat-theme]

As a design-engineering-oriented application, LobeChat places great emphasis on users' personalized experiences,
hence introducing flexible and diverse theme modes, including a light mode for daytime and a dark mode for nighttime.
Beyond switching theme modes, a range of color customization options allow users to adjust the application's theme colors according to their preferences.
Whether it's a desire for a sober dark blue, a lively peach pink, or a professional gray-white, users can find their style of color choices in LobeChat.

> \[!TIP]
>
> The default configuration can intelligently recognize the user's system color mode and automatically switch themes to ensure a consistent visual experience with the operating system.
> For users who like to manually control details, LobeChat also offers intuitive setting options and a choice between chat bubble mode and document mode for conversation scenarios.

## üõ≥ Self Hosting

LobeChat provides Self-Hosted Version with Vercel and [Docker Image][docker-release-link]. This allows you to deploy your own chatbot within a few minutes without any prior knowledge.

> \[!TIP]
>
> Learn more about [üìò Build your own LobeChat][docs-self-hosting] by checking it out.

### `A` Deploying with Vercel, Zeabur or Sealos

If you want to deploy this service yourself on either Vercel or Zeabur, you can follow these steps:

- Prepare your [OpenAI API Key](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys).
- Click the button below to start deployment: Log in directly with your GitHub account, and remember to fill in the `OPENAI_API_KEY`(required) and `ACCESS_CODE` (recommended) on the environment variable section.
- After deployment, you can start using it.
- Bind a custom domain (optional): The DNS of the domain assigned by Vercel is polluted in some areas; binding a custom domain can connect directly.

<div align="center">

</div>

#### After Fork

After fork, only retain the upstream sync action and disable other actions in your repository on GitHub.

#### Keep Updated

If you have deployed your own project following the one-click deployment steps in the README, you might encounter constant prompts indicating "updates available." This is because Vercel defaults to creating a new project instead of forking this one, resulting in an inability to detect updates accurately.

> \[!TIP]
>
> We suggest you redeploy using the following steps, [üìò Auto Sync With Latest][docs-upstream-sync]

<br/>

### `B` Deploying with Docker

[![][docker-release-shield]][docker-release-link]
[![][docker-size-shield]][docker-size-link]
[![][docker-pulls-shield]][docker-pulls-link]

We provide a Docker image for deploying the LobeChat service on your own private device. Use the following command to start the LobeChat service:

```fish
$ docker run -d -p 3210:3210 \
  -e OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-xxxx \
  -e ACCESS_CODE=lobe66 \
  --name lobe-chat \
  lobehub/lobe-chat
```

> \[!TIP]
>
> If you need to use the OpenAI service through a proxy, you can configure the proxy address using the `OPENAI_PROXY_URL` environment variable:

```fish
$ docker run -d -p 3210:3210 \
  -e OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-xxxx \
  -e OPENAI_PROXY_URL=https://api-proxy.com/v1 \
  -e ACCESS_CODE=lobe66 \
  --name lobe-chat \
  lobehub/lobe-chat
```

> \[!NOTE]
>
> For detailed instructions on deploying with Docker, please refer to the [üìò Docker Deployment Guide][docs-docker]

<br/>
